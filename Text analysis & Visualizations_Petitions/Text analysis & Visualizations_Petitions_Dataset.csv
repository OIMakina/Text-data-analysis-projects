<p>Dear Citizens</p>
<p>Historically any civilisation is revolved around the water fronts and river basins, as you all know that the Musi river is an inherent property of Hyderabadi's and it is the integral part of the Hyderabad city and the citizens, and its pollution in all forms affecting all of us as residents, communities and every visitor too. But for many years this problem has been neglected to resolve by all the governments, and the foul and stingent smell emanating from the River Musi and also the lakes like famous Hussain Sagar and the problems faced by the people residing adjacent to the river, ignored. The river has now become a sewage nala in the literal sense of the word, as the industrial effluent and waste and domestic waste are dumped in the river continually. The Telangana State government has promised to rejounevate the dying river through the ""Musi Riverfront Development Authority"" under the leadership of Sri KTR, the Honourable minister for Municipal Administration and Urban Development(MAUD) of Telangana, promising that Musi would be developed on the lines of any other rivers of India or abroad , setting aside 2500 crores, but no firm action has been seen to be taken so far. Not only the city but the villages adjoining Hyderabad have been direly affected. We hoped that at least when Telangana was formed, our Musi river - our lifeline, and the pride of Hyderabad, would be saved. However, it seems less likely with each passing day. We have been witnessing the systematic denial of the very basic human requirements for life. The human rights of the people been getting violated. The pollution percolating to all the ""Pancha Boothas"" (FIVE ELEMENTS). The air we breathe, the water we drink, Soil through which the food we eat, the sky under we live. They're all polluted now. It's now time to act to declare the <strong>""Musi Emergency""</strong> and raise the emergency funds to rejenovate the Mother River Musi and let the present and future generations Live happy and safe life.</p>
<p>Please give a thought and act accordingly but an urgent action is necessary</p>

"4",2021-03-29 18:59:49,"People: Encourage Community to use sustainably produced products","<p>The rate at which earth’s natural resources are depleting, indicates that very soon we humans will find it hard to survive. The main cause behind this is the inefficient use of resources. A large variety of products that we are using nowadays is made up of material which is harmful for the environment. The effects of the same is clearly visible in the form of Climate Change.</p>
<p>Plastic one of the most used substance in today’s time. It is seen everywhere these days, from supermarkets to common households. It is cheap and serves a lot of applications and also has an edge over alternatives such as cloth or paper due to its re-usability. Also, it is very appropriate for use as it can be moulded into any shape as per one’s requirements. Apart from advantages it offers, it has lots of disadvantages. Plastic is a non-biodegradable material i.e it cannot be dissolved or burnt out, it can only be dumped which means that it remains on the surface of the earth forever. It contains toxic substances and thus, is a major cause of pollution in nature. Plastic pollution is spreading like a disease which has no cure. Plastic pollution is spreading through the environment like wildfire. It has many adverse effects upon the lives of human beings, animals and plants alike. Every year, across the world, tons of plastic and plastic materials are dumped into rivers, lakes and ocean waters and thus, require immediate attention before it’s too late.</p>
<p>Plastic does not dissolve in water, it either keeps afloat or settles down on the surface thus, polluting water bodies to a great extent. Plastic pollution also has its due impacts upon underwater marine wildlife and plant life. The plastic dumped in the water does not dissolve. They can be mistaken as food materials by fishes and other aquatic animals; eating up the plastic causes intoxication and prolonged choking. The adverse effects of plastic and the pollution caused by it is felt in every sector. To minimize the damage done, we should be careful in our practices and uses of plastic. Though the use of plastic cannot be rooted out completely, we must at least try and reduce our dependence on it.</p>
<p>Plastics do have become an indispensable ingredient of modern life but in order to protect our environment from the harm it cause, we must start using sustainably produced products. These products do not harm the environment, whether in their production, use or disposal. We must use alternatives like cloth bags and paper bags instead of plastic bags. If we are purchasing plastic, we must reuse it. We must avoid drinking bottled water which contributes largely to plastic pollution.</p>
<p>Let’s bring a change together. Every one of us knows what plastic is here to say. But how we let it stays left to us.</p>","active"

<p><strong>A person does not simply ""get over"" mental illness without some form of treatment. Mental illness is generally a lifelong, chronic medical condition that needs consistent treatment.</strong></p>
<p>As per the National Mental Health Survey, the prevalence of psychiatric illness was about 7.3% in adolescents aged between 13-17 years due to depression, anxiety disorders, substance use disorder and attentive deficit hyperactive disorder which later leads to suicides. Psychiatric illnesses are the leading cause of children suicides in India.</p>
<p>Our objective through this petition is “To develop a school-based mental health justice program for youth in India.” Just like Mid-day Meals Scheme, there should be free counselling sessions, workshops, lectures about mental health in all schools and in workspace.</p>

"11",2020-04-26 18:31:38,"ministry of finance: PM ensure: Tax-benefits & low-interest-loans for women-owned enterprise post-lockdown","<p>The COVID emergency in India has led to a nationwide lockdown, not only leading to an economic standstill but also making some people more vulnerable to the economic crises than others. Women are one of the most vulnerable groups and prone to massive social, political and economic impacts due to pre-existing inequalities. According to the United Nation’s policy brief on the impact of COVID on women, the crises threatens a rollback of the limited gains made in gender equality. In the economic sphere, where 65% of women are employed in the unorganized sector, they are more susceptible to losing their jobs than men. Not only is the lack of social security nets, a danger, but the pay-gap also puts women at a greater disadvantage. As the crises unfold, the impact on women from various intersectionality is becoming clearer which calls for a gender-lens in the national pandemic response. Women are paid less, have access to lesser jobs and are therefore more prone to economic shocks. These can greatly affect families, particularly in female-headed households. The impact especially aggravates for women who are already living on economic margins. Women-led businesses make up to 14% of business establishments in India where most of them are small-scale enterprises. The lockdown threatens the sustainability of these businesses. Additionally, women entrepreneurs are more likely to face roadblocks post-lockdown due to lack of resources and glass ceilings that deprives them of a level-playing field.</p>
<p>The policy at the national level lacks a comprehensive gendered analysis of the situation. As government initiative, the WEP under NITI Aayog tried to reach out to women-led small-scale businesses and startups for the procurement of raw material, supply and distribution of cloth masks made by women workers as a means of income, but the initiative is not enough. It is still unable to cover a large portion of entrepreneurial and working women in the country who need aid. Women workers and entrepreneurs require economic support and policy framework that safeguards their jobs and businesses. There are not clear assurances of economic security measures for women that can help support them during the lockdowns. In light of these issues that require immediate attention, we demand the government to:</p>
<p><strong>Ensure tax relief for all women-owned businesses during and after the lockdown in both rural and urban India.</strong></p>
<p>Provide NBFC finances to small scale women-led businesses and Self Help Groups at the lowest interest rate possible. (The current interest rate is nearly 9%, which should be reduced by 50-60%). ( Relief to SHGs for non-collateral loans but the interest rate is same. However, no support to women-led businesses which are majorly urban centred businesses)</p>
<p>Creation of economic security net for women working in the informal sector, through direct cash transfers, subsidies and effective job-creation initiatives post-lockdown, particularly focused for women.</p>

<p>She was found brutally raped and bleeding profusely from her private parts on Thursday. According to a report by Free Press Journal, Devi Sheth, a software engineer who knows the dog well took her to an NGO for treatment. She was accompanied by other animal lovers of the area.</p>
<p>She was immediately admitted at the World For All facility in Andheri. Given that the dog was bleeding from her private parts, the veterinarians suspected a foreign object could be the cause.</p>
<p>During her emergency treatment, an 11-inch wooden rod was found inserted in her private parts with immense force leaving her internal organs butchered. It was a complicated surgery and Noorie had to be slit open chest down and lost a lot of blood in the process.</p>
<p>An FIR for this matter has already been registered under Sec 377 of the IPC (unnatural intercourse) and two sections under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act (PCA).</p>

"15",2021-03-02 15:02:58,"United States Department of Agriculture (USDA): Meat packaging should contain a label showing how humanely the animals were treated","<p><strong>While buying meat, people should know how the animals were treated for the meat and dairy products</strong>. The packaging should contain a label to show how well the animals were treated. The grading can be done by third parties, similar to ISO, HACCP and other food safety certifications. It can be a simple grade like A, B, C or D.</p>
<p>This simple rule will <strong>increase the transparency for the consumers.</strong></p>
<p>People naturally have compassion for animals. But today most meat manufacturers treat animals in such inhumane conditions that most of us will not even be able to watch an entire YouTube video showing how the animals are treated.</p>
<p>In a free market where the consumer is the king, why is there such a gap between how consumers would want the animals to be treated and how the animals are actually treated?</p>
<p>Due to the lack of transparency!</p>
<p>While buying meat or milk products in a supermarket, consumers do not know how most of the brands treat animals. A simple label on the packaging will help address this problem.</p>
<p>This transparency will improve the lives of millions of animals being killed (and tortured) every year. But more importantly, this rule will make the change with the power of transparency, and not by making it compulsory for the manufacturers to treat the animals in a certain way.</p>
<p>Almost all the manufacturers already get audited for different food-related norms/certifications. Audits for this label can also be added along with the other regular audits, so the cost of adding this label might be negligible for the manufacturers.</p>
<p>Thus, the FDA/USDA should make it mandatory for meat and dairy product manufacturers to have a label representing how the animals are treated.</p>","active"

Please help me build the momentum we need to save thousands of lives #mentalhealthinschools","<p>Growing up, I never heard terms like depression, anxiety, mental health; just the occasional ‘suicides’ reported in the news channels. I always thought that something must be wrong with youngsters who choose to take their lives, <strong>until I faced a similar situation in 2017 when I decided to take mine due to a spine injury that ended my career in the Armed Forces (National Defence Academy).</strong></p>
<p>It wasn’t long before I went through Depression and PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder). I found myself flailing in the ocean of helplessness and silence. Back in those days I thought I was the only one who was going through this, but when I looked around<strong> there were so many</strong>; some my age, some elder, but <strong>mostly younger</strong>.</p>
<p>I did some research only to find out that <strong>one student dies by suicide every hour in India</strong>, and one out of four students in 13-15 age group is <strong>depressed</strong> in India. India has the <strong>highest suicide rate</strong> among the ten South-East Asian Countries.</p>
<p>While there are a lot of conversations around mental health, breaking the stigma, and its importance among schoolchildren, the <strong>ground level reality is abysmal</strong>. Even the <strong>NEP 2020</strong>, and the <strong>Manodarpan</strong> Initiative by the Education Ministry has <strong>not addressed the issue sufficiently</strong>.</p>
<p>The ask of the petition is to<strong> incorporate Mandatory Mental Health Curriculum(non-graded) in all public and private schools.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What does a Mental Health Curriculum include?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Understanding</strong> mental health and mental illness, the <strong>stigma</strong> of mental illness,<strong> information</strong> on specific mental illnesses, <strong>experiences</strong> of mental illness, <strong>seeking help</strong> and emotional support, the <strong>importance</strong> of positive mental health.</li>
<li> <strong>Social-Emotional Learning</strong> (SEL).</li>
<li><strong>Life Skills Training</strong></li>
<li><strong>Parent(s) and Teacher(s) training.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The curriculum is <strong>not about adding more syllabus</strong>, but rather <strong>educating and sensitizing</strong> the students through dialogues, discussions, activities, feedbacks, exercises, skill training, etc. It’s high time that the trend of ‘observing’ a ‘mental health week/day’ in schools once a year changes to <strong>all-year round curriculum;</strong> or else it loses its effectiveness just like the sad state of ‘sex education’ in schools.</p>

<ol>
<li>The <strong>precision tracking feature</strong> of the app could be used to identify the household where help is needed.</li>

It is already a challenge for survivors to obtain justice in the Indian legal system, and those from the country’s marginalized communities face even more major barriers.<br>Although about 100 new cases are reported every day to the police, reporting rates throughout the country are devastatingly low, with one government survey finding that 99.1 percent of cases go unreported.<br>Yet, as of 2016, the most recent data available, there were over 133, 000 sexual violence cases awaiting trial and conviction rates are very low. Survivors of sexual violence face huge barriers in accessing justice, including community pressure to drop the case, discriminatory attitudes of police and judicial officers, insufficient legal aid and discouraging conviction rates. <br>In India, society often still shifts blame onto survivors, shaming a survivor and her family into silence. This is especially true among those are already marginalized within Indian society, leaving them particularly vulnerable to sexual violence. This culture of shame follows survivors into law enforcement, the court system and into hospitals, further silencing survivors’ voices.<br>Survivors may have great difficulty accessing counseling services, or have no access, and must contend with insufficient legal support, including delays in filing their complaints.<br>In the last 10 days,3 horrible cases of rape have been reported in india amongst a dozen others.In one of them,a young girl(19) was kidnapped in broad daylight from the field by a group of males and was dragged to a secluded place.They dragged her so roughly that most of her bones were broken along with her spinal cord,permanently paralysing her.They then gang raped her and killed her.Her parents later found her--bloodied,mutilated,lifeless.<br>Another girl was raped and her bones were broken and her tongue was ripped off.She died while she was hospitalized. <br>Yet another girl was raped by a minister's son and his group of friends and her body was burnt by the police themselves because the police were corrupt and bribed by the minister's son.<br>This is going out of hand.Take a few minutes to save countless innocent lives and sign up this petition.Lets hope the targeted authorities try and take some stern measures against these to promote gender equality,ban rape culture,and also make laws against rape much more powerful,stern and also to prescribe extreme torture to be meted out to the rapists,followed by immediate death.<br>Kindly sign this petitions if you wish to give your daughter (or your own self) a better tommorow.</p>","active"

<p>The young feline was malnourished and barely breathing which instantly melted my heart. I immediately called Bluecross hoping the kitten would get the help he needed. But the response I received was shocking!</p>
<p>The associate insisted I must provide first aid ( which I did, took the kitten to the veterinary hospital) and raise the kitten myself as Bluecross Chennai do not provide shelter to animals unless they are seriously injured.  My disappointment continued to grow as I reached out to many namesake shelters which I found through Google search and later to slowly discover none of them have a shelter around the city.  </p>
<p>I am baffled and deeply resenting by the way we treat our four-legged neighbors.  Having lived in abroad for several years now, I can immediately spot the difference.  Everything must change!  Have we lost all the compassion? Saddening. </p>
<p>Presently, only animals that are seriously injured are admitted in the shelter and it takes about two hours for any welfare worker to reach the affected animal. Other animals are left ""abandoned"" not only by the NGOs, but also by our Government. Stranded Kittens and Puppies cannot endure life-threatening situations without proper care.  This must change.</p>
<p><strong>I am starting this petition to achieve two things:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li> <strong>Proper Intervention to increase shelter capacity to house the animals.  </strong></li>
<li><strong>Government to support NGOs to recruit welfare workers to transport the abandoned animals to the shelters in a timely manner so the required care is available to them</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>I welcome your support in this cause. As Mahatma Gandhi said, “The greatness of a nation and its moral progress can be judged by the way its animals are treated.”  Let's sign this petition: to demand justice and to increase animal shelters across the state, so no animal is left abandoned.  </p>","active"

<p>the problem :</p>
<p>In an effort to raise the awareness about the plastic waste we generate and the companies like zomato, swiggy , uber eats etc to give concern about the use  of plactic in their packaging. i dont know  why FASSAI's new packaging regulations bans the use of recycled plastics in food packaging. While EU is making an effort to use recycled plastic in packaging to ensure lesser impact on environment.</p>
<p>India is one of the top five markets for packaged food in the world, and the second largest in Asia, with a sales volume of 34 million tonne. Hence, it important to move towards more environment friendly packaging option as we have power to define the standards at an international level.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>solution :</p>
<p>1. create new forms of food packaging to replace the unsustainable designs upon which modern life seems to depend: single-use plastic beverage cups, lids, straws, and bottles.</p>
<p>2. use  of recycle plastic</p>
<p>3.  initiation  of plastic collection drives </p>
<p>Once the innocent consumer comes to know that Rs 5 maggie packet will take 200 years to decompose only then masses will move towards more environment friendly option and so will the companies.

<p>Private Schools are hiking their fees every year! From 15% to 25% and sometimes as high as 200%. No reasons given ,no consent taken. So where is all the money going?</p>
<p>Clearly not where it matters the most as has been exposed by increasing incidents like the latest Ryan school tragedy.</p>
<p><strong>This Profiteering and commercialisation of education must stop.</strong></p>
<p>As a mother I have been struggled with the fee hikes myself. As a lawyer I have been fighting court cases on behalf of these aggrieved parents.</p>
<p><strong>The Supreme Court in 2004 had directed all state governments to enact a fee regulation act and constitute a fee regulation committee.</strong> Despite several such SC judgements only some states like Maharashtra, Tamilnadu, Punjab, Gujarat Haryana and Rajasthan have enacted the act so far.</p>
<p>However every state has a different fee regulation act. They have shortcomings which have come in the way of their proper implementation. </p>
<p><strong>Education is the responsibility of both the Centre and the States.</strong> <strong>The Central government must act now because states have failed in trying to curb this growing racket.</strong> That’s why I started this petition asking the Education Minister, Prakash Javadekar, to introduce a law to regulate fee hikes across all private schools in India.</p>
<p>The MHRD can intervene in two ways:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Make an amendment in RTE act and include provision for regulation of Fees.</strong> Appoint a committee at the central level (central free regulatory committee)and state level (State fee regulatory committee). The committee at the central level should be an appellate body.</p>
<p>2.<strong> Make a separate legislation with stringent provisions for fee regulation.</strong> Under this there can be a fee regulatory bodies both at the central, state and the district level.</p>
<p>a. The state and district committees should be empowered to look into the accounts of the schools and trusts to check for any profiteering and commercial activities.<br>b. The committee should be able to penalise any school found to be charging excess fees. The excess amount should be refunded to parents.<br>c. For fee revision it must be mandatory for schools to submit their proposal and justify the hike. <br>d. Schools should not be allowed to collect fees till their accounts have been verified by these committees. The verification should be displayed on the school notice board <br>e. Parents should be able to approach these committees in case of fee disputes or complaints</p>
<p><strong>Government intervention is the need of the hour to ensure that education does not become a tool to siphon off money.</strong></p>
<p>School should be free to set their fee structure provided it is reasonable and not amounting to profiteering.</p>
<p><strong>I therefore request the HRD minister to step in and bring about the much needed reform and consider this proposal for enacting a central legislation or to amend RTE act.</strong></p>","active"

"41",2021-04-13 03:44:03,"United Nations: Women should be given all of the rights","<p>We are all entitled to human rights. These include the right to live free from violence and discrimination; to enjoy the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health; to be educated; to own property; to vote; and to earn an equal wage.</p>
<p>But across the globe many women and girls still face discrimination on the basis of sex and gender. Gender inequality underpins many problems which disproportionately affect women and girls, such as domestic and sexual violence, lower pay, lack of access to education, and inadequate healthcare.</p>
<p>For many years women’s rights movements have fought hard to address this inequality, campaigning to change laws or taking to the streets to demand their rights are respected. And new movements have flourished in the digital age, such as the #MeToo campaign which highlights the prevalence of gender-based violence and sexual harassment.</p>
<p>During the 19th and early 20th centuries people began to agitate for the right of women to vote. In 1893 New Zealand became the first country to give women the right to vote on a national level. This movement grew to spread all around the world, and thanks to the efforts of everyone involved in this struggle, today women's suffrage is a right under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (1979).</p>
<p>However, despite these developments there are still many places around the world where it is very difficult for women to exercise this right.  Take Syria for example, where women have been effectively cut off from political engagement, including the ongoing peace process.</p>
<p>In Pakistan, although voting is a constitutional right, in some areas women have been effectively prohibited from voting due to powerful figures in their communities using patriarchal local customs to bar them from going to the polls.When looking at women’s rights it’s helpful to have an understanding of feminism. At its core, feminism is the belief that women are entitled to political, economic, and social equality. Feminism is committed to ensuring women can fully enjoy their rights on an equal footing with men.</p>

I am sure that even they would be feeling that pain and knowing that this is wrong and it has to be stopped, but here in India and maybe in other countries, people like to enjoy even serious matters and just stand and do nothing. Let us sign this petition and make it successful so that these poor animals get their freedom from our cruelty, and stop this torture once it for all. </p>","active"

<p>If they really respect female than the percentage of rape did't increase day by day ? Some rapist didn't even get shamed ? They raped the female children's who is even unalbe to speak , what did they get from them ? If the higher authority of the world or we talk about specifically our country , the higher authority must take a very strict decision that the rapist dont even think of being stand in front of female and see them by their cheap eyes . </p>
<p>The best solution is that they didn't get the chance to live in this world , where they are also came out from the female's womb . They didn't respect their GOD who gave birth to them , then why did they get chance to live . Just encounter such rapist !!! </p>

Which are used for entertainment purpose. They are not entertainers. They can't speak or express their feelings vocally that doesn't mean you can do whatever you want with them. They are here on Planet Earth just like us. If they are not interfering in your life so why are you? </p>
<p>In this year of pandemic when I was at home doing nothing just eating, sleeping and watching movies or doing other stuff to pass the time. But after some months I felt really exhausted. I got bored. Even when I was at home my urge to get out of the house was big. I wanted to go out, to take fresh breathe outside, to roam, to meet people but I couldn't. Then I saw something on Facebook that showed how animals feels at the zoo. You can feed them, you can watch them, you can spend some time with them but after that what? They also want to go outside, to feel free from the closed doors, to experience that the world is bigger than the four walls, roam around the jungle, to enjoy the beauty of nature. Nature is same for all of us. Let them live free.</p>
<p>Animals like Horse, Bullock, Camels, Donkeys and Yaks are used for transportation. Elephants are also used in Indian forests on tiger safaris. These animals are forced to carry the burden. Now imagine carrying something heavy on the back and roaming during the hot day where temperature is 25°C to 45 °C and it's rising every year. Their body structure is different but they do feel the heat. They are thirsty, dehydrated, they feel the pain but still they carry the load. </p>
<p>Now talking about the dairy farms, India is the highest producer of milk in the world and there are 150 million dairy farmers. People use milk in their day to day life but they don't know the reality of some of the dairy farms that what they do with cows and buffaloes to produce the daily limit of milk. Google it, you can see the results. Here are some links where you can find it by yourself :</p>

<p>I don't understand why they are doing this. If you want to make money from them then take the responsibility too. Why are you acting such inhumanly with them. Why can't they just produce it in the natural way? What will happen at the most? your production will be low but at least the cows and buffaloes will be in good condition. You take care of them, they will take care of you. It's simple. </p>
<p>I have one last point for the viewers. I was doing the same like you, Ignoring the reality of the world. It's like a truth, you can ignore it but you can't hide it. I need your help.

Suicide has become the SECOND leading cause of death for teenagers, only worsened by Covid-19. Rates of suicidal thinking and behavior are up by 25 percent or more since 2019 and there is a dramatic rise in teens coming into the emergency room*.</p>
<p>Yet, it is reported that adolescents and young adults have the worst access to health care than all other age groups**. Here in Berkshire County, there are NO inpatient or day treatment hospital programs available for teens - anywhere in our county - for when they become suicidal or try to take their lives. On top of that many adolescent psychiatric hospital services in other areas of Massachusetts have closed their doors. Children are being sent home from the emergency room after near fatal suicide attempts because there are just no beds available across the state. </p>
<p>We are in imminent need of adolescent psychiatric hospital services in Berkshire County to save the lives of our young people. Our county has been under-resourced for too long and there are so many families here in daily crisis. All adolescents need and deserve access to comprehensive care to address the unique challenges they face. We are responsible for getting our teens the help they need to stay alive. </p>
<p>These services have been available to adults - but NOT teens for decades. Berkshire Health Systems have the resources to open an adolescent wing at BMC. The Jones II unit is currently closed and could be re-opened to provide inpatient services for teens if we - as a community - speak up.</p>
<p>If we work together we can make change. Please join me in petitioning for adolescent psychiatric hospital services in Berkshire County.</p>

<p>we would like to Inform you about the background and facts of our issue and update you with the necessary development in our case. We are expecting your help, involvement and necessary guidance to deal the matter</p>
<p>Background of the Issue: -</p>
<p>Movement (Sequence) of the Case: </p>
<p>SRS Royal Hills Sec 87 , Faridabad -121003 project started in 2007-2008 &amp; 1500 + family (5000 resident) book their dream home in this project from 2007 -2015 .</p>
<p>Till 2015/16 whole project (100%) was sold.</p>
<p>In 2014 builder (SRS Real Estate) start giving possession of flat tower by tower after receiving 100% amount from buyer. Buyer were happy to take passion of their dream home but they ask about the flat registry to builder but builder told first you shift we will send you details about registry of flat with in a month but after several follow up builder don’t turn up &amp; till 2015/16 whole society flat handover to buyer &amp; in this 2 years only 200 registry done buy the builder .</p>
<p>Buyer rigorously follow to register their flat nothing turns up, even buyer also done the agitation at builder office at that time builder did false commitment again &amp; ask the time of one month.</p>
<p> In 2017 some of the buyer create association- Fights for Rights &amp; filled the case on 32 points in NCDRC (National Consumer Forum) now 2 year passed but not a single decision done in NCRDC, we are still struggling in NCRDC.</p>
<p>On dated 21-nov-2017 Canara bank paste one notice of symbolic possession of flat in SARFAESI act on our society gate.</p>
<p>Then we enquire about it then we get to know builder take the loan from Canara bank around 100 CR &amp; after summing up of interest current amount is 104 cr. (on dated Nov-2017).</p>
<p>We get to know builder fail to repay the 100 cr. Loan to Canara bank &amp; Bank try to recover money from innocent buyers.</p>
<p>We all homebuyers were unaware of this fact and had approached at DRT for the stay in our case, and accordingly, we also approach to lander bank (HDFC, SBI, LIC, Axis &amp; other) as they have provided the load on this property to safe guard the interest of their loan amount but mostly bank dose not show any interest .</p>
<p>In between one more group of buyers more to High court (Haryana) &amp; after several hearing High court order advised all the homebuyers to present the representation to Canara bank with the payment detail along with all necessary documents. Accordingly, Canara Bank has to pass the speaking order after accepting the representation and by giving opportunity of personal hearing within 3 months of the order date.</p>
<p>We all residents has represented and got the Personal hearing from Canara Bank. Canara bank during our PH (Physical Hearing) had asked/ verify some basic questions/detail from us. In response to the PH we have shown them the NIL Balance ledger confirming that all dues were paid and no balance is outstanding against us.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On dated 11-July-2019 DRT order to Canara bank to recover money by allotting the recovery Notice (OA/4382/2017).</p>
<p>Without hearing buyers appeal DRT Chandigarh issue the order in favor of Canara bank. </p>
<p>Canara bank also move to NCLT for recovery of their money.</p>

<p>Now we innocent buyer on the verge of losing our Dream Home as no one is there to hear our voice, builder in Jail, Court give the order in favor of Bank &amp; Govt. is deaf &amp; dumb at last we decided to take help of media.</p>
<p>We 5000 resident in hope media will help us so that Deaf &amp; Dump govt. wake up &amp; help 5000 residents.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our Finding / Observation in the Case: -</p>
<p>1.      Bank has verified all the documents and done proper due diligence and financed us.  </p>
<p>2.      We are bonafide buyers of the property and our rights are protected under TP Act (Transfer of Property)</p>
<p>3.      We have obtained the NIL balance ledger from the builder and taken the possession.</p>
<p>4.      We all are either staying or have given the property at rent.</p>
<p>5.      It seems Carnara bank and builder has done something wrong or they have not verified all the facts at their end as money given by buyers need to go in escrow account but that amount not go in Escrow account this can be done without handshake between bank &amp; builder.</p>
<p>6.      We are approaching all remedy which are available to us.</p>
<p>7.      We all residents are at risk of being homeless.</p>
<p>8.      We are requesting your involvement and help from you.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Humble Request / Prayer</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It is our humble request to you that We all are middle income people who have put all their hard-earned money under this project and duly paying the EMI on time to bank.</p>
<p>Bank has vested interest in our property, and it is duty of bank also to safeguard our as well as your interest but all of the bank is failed on this. We prayer to you kindly help us in this matter in fighting along with you.</p>
<p>We hope you will understand our genuine concerns and help us from this harassment as soon as possible.</p>","active"
"55",2021-04-13 06:26:57,"Election Commision of India: Ban all political rallies and meetings in West Bengal to bring down the spread of COVID-19","<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am a student of class <strong>XII</strong> and will write my <strong>Board examination</strong> in the coming month of May. But, lately, the problem that we, that is, I and my fellow students are facing is the <strong>rising number of COVID-19</strong> cases across India.</p>
<p>The rising number of COVID-19 cases has caused many students to panic and sign and write petitions to the respective <strong>examination Boards to postpone or cancel</strong> the Board exams. However, that <em>does not </em>seem to be a <em>good solution</em>.</p>
<p>In West Bengal, we are currently having our Legislative Assembly elections. Due to these elections, <strong>Political Parties</strong> are holding an innumerable number of rallies and meetings, making innumerable people come in proximity and that too, without maintaining the COVID protocols - <strong>nobody wears a mask</strong> - neither the <em>Politicians</em> nor the <em>commoners</em>.</p>
<p>So, my request is to cancel or ban any such further meetings or rallies by <strong>ANY </strong>Political Party, to ensure the safety of us, the students. Help us fight against the rising tide of COVID cases, as holding meetings and rallies maintaining COVID protocols is practically impossible.</p>
<ol>
<li>We, the students want to give our final school examinations with less fear and more security, so a reducing graph of COVID-19 cases will brighten the chances of such a happening.</li>
<li>Not that the disease cannot spread from anywhere else other than political rallies, but they seem to be like <em>super-spreaders</em>.</li>
<li>If a ban is put on such <em>meeting or rallies</em>, they will ensure a <strong>lower rate of spread</strong> of COVID-19 cases.</li>
<li>The ban will also ensure smoother traffic on roads, as such meetings often block a part of the road or the whole of a road, which is really very painful especially during office hours</li>
<li>The ban will probably also ensure a <em>calmer </em>environment for the remaining four phases of the election to be held in West Bengal, as such meetings often offer <em>provocation </em>to <em>some </em>people, and things get agitated.</li>
<li>We must keep in mind that, we <strong>DO NOT</strong> have as many <em>hospital beds</em> in the whole country to cope with the rising number of cases.</li>
<li>We are already seeing the highest number of daily cases since March 2020, and I hope it is a <em>warning signal 'loud' enough</em> to make every one of us <em>alert</em> of the <strong>consequences</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>""So please, oh please, we beg, we pray,""</strong> <em>(-Roald Dahl, 'Television')</em>, to stop further political rallies, to be held by any political parties, irrespective of their role in this Assembly Elections.</p>

"56",2021-04-05 19:31:39,"Sharad Arvind Bobde: Women Freedom from Burka and veil","<p>Ban the Burqa/ veil and Let women ""Breath""</p>
<p>women identity is their ""fundamental right""</p>
<p>* IPC_section 96 to 106..*   Right of Private Defence </p>
<p>Till the day women continue to don the burqa or ghoonghat, they will be treated as sexual objects, as slaves dedicated to men. Governments and societies cannot allow this</p>
<p>The far-right in India have consistently demanded a ban on triple talaq, a uniform civil code, and doing away with Sharia law. The ones who should have been at the forefront of making these demands have never done so: liberals. Liberals are not blinded by religion; they are often not even religious. They believe in human rights, freedom of speech, women’s equality, truth and compassion. But when it comes to Muslim women, they are silent.</p>
<p>In many parts of the world, including India, Muslim women are not always allowed to go to colleges and universities, or to take a job, are often married off young and are forced to cover themselves in the burqa. For the crime of being born female, they are systematically deprived of equal rights in everything—from marriage to divorce, child custody and inheritance.</p>
<p>The burqa signifies this oppression and that is why this debate, most recently sparked off by the ban on the all-enveloping veil that Sri Lanka has imposed after the Easter Sunday bombings, is so important.</p>
<p>India’s far-right has been vocal about the burqa. This is not because they are sympathetic to the cause of Muslim women. In their propaganda, Muslims are not modern, they contribute in no way to the betterment of society, they imprison women behind the veil, they are not fit to be citizens of India, they are capable of only committing bad deeds, violence and bloodshed are endemic to them, their chief problems lie in their religion, in their religious texts and laws. I wish for Muslims to become secular and enlightened and move towards establishing a modern, equal society. My position is always against any kind of religious fanaticism, including the Hindu kind.</p>
<p>Any talk about a ban on the burqa makes liberals as well as many Muslims go into shock. People are saying banning the burqa won’t stop terrorism. I agree it won’t stop terrorism, but it will definitely stop women from being faceless zombies.</p>
<p>Several highly-developed democracies like Belgium, Austria, Bulgaria, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, The Netherlands and Norway, with strong human-rights credentials, have banned the burqa either partially or completely. In many countries in West Asia, feminists have raised this demand, too.</p>
<p>The burqa needs to be banned across the globe. Once that is done, Muslim women will be able to move around without having to carry around a mobile prison at all times as punishment for having been born as female.</p>
<p>The women who claim they like wearing the burqa or that it is part of their rights do so because they have been indoctrinated into believing so. There is no question of choice here.</p>
<p>In 2010, an old article of mine on the burqa issue was reprinted in a journal in Karnataka and that, too, without my knowledge. It sparked riots in two cities. Obviously, it was the men who rioted even though the issue at hand was women’s wear. This should tell you all that it is usually men who decide what women should wear. If the burqa is indeed such a blessing, why do men not show interest in donning it?</p>
<p>That women, too, have sexual desires, that they, too, can make advances at a man, these are proven facts.</p>
<p>So if women are expected to keep themselves covered from head to toe, so they don’t end up stoking a man’s desires, then men, too, ought don the burqa to ensure they don’t similarly incite women. But other than thieves, goons, murderers and terrorists, no man will wear the burqa because they feel it will damage their masculinity, like sarees or bangles do.</p>
<p>Let women say, ‘if you cannot control your sexual excitement, that’s your problem not mine. You cannot cover me up because you have a problem. I am not your private property that you will decide for me what I should wear. Where I should go, how far. I will wear kohl if I wish to and if my dark gaze is a problem for you, then don’t glance at me. If your eyes stray regardless and if your manhood causes you too much hardship, then hide your eyes behind a thick blindfold’.</p>
<p>Some are saying that if the burqa is banned in India then the ghoonghat, the veil prevalent among Hindus and other non-Muslims, needs to be banned too. I say: yes.</p>
<p>In the 21st century, men still believe women’s heads, faces and hair have to be covered so that no one other than their husbands can see them—in other words, women are the property of their husbands. Till the day women continue to don the burqa or the ghoonghat, they will continue to be treated as sexual objects, as slaves dedicated to men.</p>
<p>Governments and societies cannot allow this — any more than any other form of human slavery can be tolerated.</p>
<p>I read and experienced about this issue. It is very important for freedom of Women in 21st century.</p>

Now I use 1.5 gb data per day (and on some days, even more). How and why? A certain company gave me ""that"" choice. I didn't know it could be an option. But they made it known to me that it's an option. And that's how I started to prefer it. And that's how all the other companies started mimicking ""the trend"". And that's why I now get scolded by my parents for being online 24*7!</p>
<p>So, a company systematically established a certain behaviour in me, without me even realising that.</p>
<p>Similarly, when companies tell you that they (people) ""preferred"" it when asked ""why they (companies) chose a female voice for Alexa"", please bother to ask them and yourselves, who gave them (or us) those preferences? Companies. When testing their products, companies get to decide what choices the customers will get to pick from. That's where the bias begins. Then, people pick from those choices. How do people choose or prefer? That too stems from our psychology. Another bias. So, don't blame the customers ""exclusively and particularly"" for choosing a female voice for Alexa. <strong>Bias is an inescapable human trait but does it also have to pervade our technology now?Agreed that machines were built to simulate the human mind but should they also simulate our stereotypes and biases?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ask the right question — why must all the virtual assistants have female voices, female names, and female mannerisms by default? Why was gendering technology so important? Since when have technology, innovation, and science started being labelled under a particular gender? Does science even have a gender? Should science have a gender?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Alexa</strong> named after the library of Alexandria, could have been Alex. Apple’s Siri translates to “a beautiful woman who leads you to victory” in Old Norse. Microsoft's Cortana’s namesake is a fictional synthetic intelligence character in the Halo video-game series, with no physical form, but projects a holographic version of ""herself"".</p>
<p>Hence, <strong>our “21st century digital” universe is fraught with “17th century social” problems</strong> — <strong>although they lack bodies, they (VAs) embody what we think of when we picture a personal assistant: a competent, efficient, deferential, and meek woman who does all the big and small tasks ordered by one but she is always polite and obedient and hence, it’s no accident that Siri, Cortana, and Alexa, all have female voices, female names, and female mannerisms “by default”</strong>. <strong>People are conditioned to expect women, not men, to be in “assistance” roles—and that the makers of digital assistants are influenced by these social expectations which is why AI technology adapted to pre-existing stereotypes, and helped to perpetuate them.</strong> So, the gendering of AI became inevitable. <strong><a href=""https://www.change.org/p/amazon-ungenderai-to-stop-technology-from-reinforcing-problematic-gender-stereotypes/sign-now"" rel=""nofollow"">Sign my petition</a></strong> to help change this. </p>
<p>There are a few assistants that have a male voice as an option. But, as one of the widely used platforms, I am<strong> asking Amazon to lead the way with Alexa by stopping the reinforcement of problematic gender stereotypes in AI by:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Ending the regressive practice of making voice assistants female by default</strong> </li>
<li>
<strong>Developing a genderless voice assistant</strong> (<a href=""https://www.google.com/amp/s/techgrabyte.com/q-genderless-voice-assistant/amp/"" rel=""nofollow"">like Q</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Imparting regular gender-sensitive training to AI developers within the company</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>UNESCO’s 2019 report titled <a href=""https://en.unesco.org/news/first-unesco-recommendations-combat-gender-bias-applications-using-artificial-intelligence"" rel=""nofollow"">“I’d Blush If I Could”</a> mentioned that “<strong>their hardwired subservience influences how people speak to female voices and models how women respond to requests and express themselves</strong>. To change course, we need to pay much closer attention to <strong>how, when and whether AI technologies are gendered and, crucially, who is gendering them.</strong>” The title of the report is, in fact, a reference to the standard answer given by the default female-voice of Apple’s Siri, in response to insults from users. </p>
<p><strong>When we confidently imagine AI as a subservient woman, we reinforce dangerous and outdated stereotypes of women into not just our imagination but also our science, innovation, and technology.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We must not chain ourselves to the ‘shoulds’ of gender-based preconceptions and misconceptions. But here we are, busy gendering technology and fighting to justify why it’s important for technology to have a gender. We haven’t fixed sexism or racism or any other -ism in humanity yet, but here we are halfway through coding them into technology. Technology is, and should be meant to benefit all members of society, regardless of their age, gender, religion or status in society, rather than replicate human biases, perpetuate disparities or widen the gap between the haves and have nots. </strong></p>
<p>So, it’s high time that we shoulder our responsibility of <strong>creating and inspiring technology that is not only effective but also ungendered enough to break existing gender stereotypes and discriminatory social norms. </strong></p>

Even there are incidences when  victims have been raped second time by the same culprits. Due to lack of strong evidences and many other technical reasons. It is an irony that such rascals get legal advice , support and protection easily . If legal community unanimously decides in whole of India not to support or give any legal services or aid to perpetrators of such inhuman and heinous crime then it may create fear in the mind of such criminals. it will also be a tribute to all such rape victims of the past who have not yet got justice. such cirminals ought not to be given state sponsored  mandatory legal aid also in case their case is not fought by lawyers . Time has come that govt should come up with guidlines to devoid them of this through legislation if need be. Why it is necessary think of hyderabad incident demons raped the girl even when she was dead ! Humanity too died immediately.</p>
<p>there are demonstrations and protests going on  against this incident all over the country.

<p>Maintaining of social distancing is something that KL University has, frankly speaking, failed to enforce. And now it has gotten to the very worst where students and even some of the teaching and non-teaching faculty have tested positive for the virus. But instead of raising awareness about the virus, the college continued to keep this news discreet and tried (in vain) to proceed with operations as if everything was alright, but it just wasn't.</p>
<p>KL University is roughly a semester and a half ahead of other colleges in terms of the progression of their students in their respective courses and this doesn't emphasise their commitment to the teaching-learning cause, but it serves to further highlight their negligence.</p>

Himalayas are Melting","<p>Floods in Chamoli district of Uttarakhand on 7th February affected the lives of residents with 27+ dead and 170+ missing. These were caused by the melting of the Himalayan Glaciers. Considering that it is the winter season, it is certainly shocking that the glaciers are melting. It's high time to raise our voices on this issue. Only saying ""Pray for Uttarakhand"" won't make any difference.<br>We need to delve into what led to the flood, in order to develop a better understanding of the problem at hand. The Nanda-Devi Glacier on the Indo-Tibet border has melted. The possible reasons for the same could be an avalanche, irresponsible construction or climate change. Usually, Glaciers don't melt in winters but instead increase in size. Therefore the incidence of floods in February signifies the gravity of the issue. The Himalayan mountain range has more than 54000 glaciers which span over 8 countries. Himalayan glaciers provide drinking water to 1 out of 3 people and at least 130 crore people are directly dependent on them.<br>The Himalayan glaciers will meltdown if there is no change in our lifestyle and disasters like floods, landslides will be very common. The glacier's water meltdown will seep into the oceans and the oceans' water level will start rising and endangering our coastal cities. All these things are connected, resulting in us being trapped between melting glaciers and rising sea levels. Therefore, we might end up facing the disproportionate impact of climate change. <br>The Uttarakhand government had monetary compensation for the people impacted by the floods but we also need to look at other corrective measures. Infrastructure testing, that is the growth, should be sustainable by understanding the environmental impact of the projects. It will enable disaster management. One of the ways in which we could bring change would be responsible tourism. We should ensure the usage of trains for shorter distances for sensitive tourist places like the Himalayas, as according to Nasa, airplanes produce 25% extra emissions while taking off and landing. Also, we should use fewer plastics to reduce waste disposal in tourist places. The future will change with our small steps of change today.</p>","active"

<p><strong>DEATHS:</strong>As per the report by the National crime Records Bureau,10281 Indian farmers are died by sucide in 2019,10349 in 2018 so, by this ever year we are losing 10000+farmers.we need hold this and stabilise as soon as possible.</p>

<p><strong>Our petition is to move the decision-makers to a) Include Single parents in the census count so that we can be included for benefits and protection by the law b) Get status and recognition as a family for social and legal visibility </strong></p>
<p>Did you know that according to a 2019 report by the UN Women (Ref: Progress Of The World’s Women 2019-2020), 4.5% of all the households in India are run by Single Mothers?</p>
<p>That's 130 lakh (or 13 million) mothers hustling and running their homes by themselves!</p>
<p>And I bet that you didn't know that another estimated 320 lakh (or 32 million) Single Mothers are living in extended families!</p>
<p><strong>Single Fathers are not even included in the study! </strong></p>
<p>According to many statisticians, even these massive numbers are actually under projected.</p>
<p>So, how does this miscount impact our welfare and interests as Single Parents, you ask?</p>
<p>Good Question</p>
<p>Well, simply put, when a big proportion of Single Parents remain unseen and in the background when governments begin to redesign, budget, and formulate family policies, children's welfare schemes, inclusivity policies for schools, hospitals, and all other public utility systems in place among many other protective policies, guess who’s opinions are not counted?</p>
<p>Guess who loses out?</p>
<p>Yup, Single Parents do!</p>
<p>When our society, culture, and government forces us to hide behind the stigma, not only are we sub-consciously enabling the perpetuation of bad culture but we are also doing a huge disservice not only to ourselves but even to the millions of women who fulfill both roles and even those living as widows or Single Mothers within their extended families</p>
<p>Let us come forward!</p>
<p>Let us use our voices of dissent towards fixing this broken system and changing the narrative around families to include us.</p>

<p><br>The PCA Act, 1960 was passed in parliament on 26th December, 1960. It pertinent to mention that the money value of 1960 was considerably on higher side than the present money value. Hence, the amount of penalty imposed for abusing any Animal was quite suitable during 1960. But now a days the Money value have decreased to maximum extent, where as the amount of penalty to be imposed for violation of the PCA Act,1960 has not been increased proportionately. For example, as per Section 11(1)(a) of the PCA Act 1960, if any person beats, kicks, over rides, over drives, overloads, tortures or otherwise treats any Animal so as to subject it to unnecessary pain or suffering then “he shall be punishable in the case of first offence, with fine which shall not be less than Ten Rupees  but which may extend to Fifty Rupees…..”</p>
<p><br>But now a day’s penalty of Rupees ten or even that of Rupees Fifty is very negligible amount. Hence the amount in place of Rs. 10 and Rs.50 should be enhanced to        atleast Rs. 2,000.00 and  Rs. 10,000.00 respectively , i.e. atleast 200 times more due to diminution of present money value in comparison with the money value of 1960.</p>
<p><br>If the amount of penalty is increased then committing various cruelties to Animals will definitely decrease throughout the country.</p>
<p><br>In view of the fact stated above, we the Animal Welfare activist should raise our voice to amend the PCA Act, 1960 and enhance the amount of penalty accordingly.</p>","active"

<p>Dailt rape, what happened. Write about the recent Dalit case. </p>
<p><br>India is a scary place to be a woman. Men have raped eight-month-old babies as well as 100-year-old women. According to government data, nearly four women are raped every hour in this country. Girls are told how to dress to avoid ‘inviting trouble’, which is basically normalising male predatory behaviour. “You were wearing such short clothes, so you were basically asking to be raped.” NO, all women should be able to wear whatever they want without having to think about being raped or hurt badly. RESPECT WOMEN. To change this, Indians must realise that it’s not a joke, it is serious and everyone should be aware about what horrible things are currently happening. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><br>Even when women speak up about how they were raped and what they have been through, the government ignores it and acts like it is nothing. It is not nothing, that’s the main problem, it’s like rape is being normalised in India. Which is extremely wrong and disgusting. These two girls need justice, by signing this petition you will take a step towards making a change.</p>
<p><br>Two minor girls were raped by two minor men. They were taken from Baran to Kota, Jaipur, and Ajmer and were raped for three days. On September 21 the two girls were found in Kota. They tried to explain the situation to the police but the police threatened to kill them. The two men that raped these two girls were held in custody for a few days and then let go.

<p>Zoos serve as prisons for wildlife, confining animals in cramped conditions for their whole life. ANIMALS ARE NOT DECORATIONS, they are intelligent, emotional creatures that require space and interaction with the natural environment.</p>
<p>Most Zoo animals suffer from various mental illnesses due to confinement and eventually die of stress related diseases. Kaavan the elephant also suffered from an intense case of 'Zoochosis' due to which he would always be swaying his head from side to side. The bears in Lahore Zoo were the same. These are only the animals I have seen personally.</p>
<p>Moreover, Zoos have a terrible impact on social mindset. What are we teaching our children? That animals are meant to be caged and displayed for our entertainment? “A good deed done to an animal is like a good deed done to a human being, while an act of cruelty to an animal is as bad as cruelty to a human being,” ~ Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him)</p>
<p>The story of Kaavan has opened our eyes to animal cruelty in Pakistan and given us a chance at redemption, let's not let the momentum die out. IT IS NOW OR NEVER. It is possible to change our current systems of cruelty. Zoos are an outdated aspect of society no matter how much they are renovated. The concept is flawed.</p>
<p>Pakistan also lacks basic facilities for stray animals. 50,000 dogs are poisoned or shot EVERY YEAR. Culling programs are ineffective at controlling populations and only lead to immense animal suffering... Often, puppies whose mothers have been killed, starve to death.</p>
<p>There are no government funded shelters and for small, private ones, every day is a struggle. Animals that have been hit by cars, abused and orphaned have no option but to die excruciating deaths.</p>
<p>Public mindset towards dogs, donkeys, and other animals is also one of resentment. Shelters and rescue services will make people aware of the needs of our street animals and what our behavior towards them should be.</p>
<p>It is time to ABOLISH ZOOS completely and ESTABLISH SHELTERS for our neglected strays. Share the petition and urge the Pakistani government to #ABOLISHZOOSESTABLISHSHELTERS. And, finally, talk about it with your friends, family and community.

<p>As a student who travels frequently, I wish I had an option of choosing a woman cab and autorickshaw driver; I would have felt a lot more comfortable and safer, but the harsh reality is that there are <strong>hardly any commercial cab drivers and autorickshaw drivers who are women</strong>.</p>
<p>I strongly feel that <strong>women drivers</strong> would make women passengers, like me, feel much safer.  </p>
<p><strong>Training and hiring women</strong> as drivers will also benefit cab companies as this will boost their public image and profit as studies show that- <strong>women are less rash on the road, pay more heed to the traffic rules and that they are also less likely to drink and drive.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sign my petition asking Ola Cabs and Uber to commit to training and inducting 200 women in Mumbai as commercial cab and autorickshaw drivers by Women’s Day, 2020. #Cabs4Her</strong></p>
<p><em>Five amazing changes that will benefit all of society are sure to be sparked off when both of these big brands rolls out cabs by women, for women. They are<br></em><em> </em><br><em>1. More demand for cleaner public toilets</em><br><em>2. Cleaner, less smelly cities, </em><br><em>3. Better lit roads </em><br><em>4. Lower crime rate </em><br><em>5. Gender-friendly RTO and government offices.</em></p>
<p>Given how this new age new-age cab and autorickshaw aggregators are growing with millions of dollars being pumped in by investors, it is clear that they are the <strong>most capable companies to drive the change to get more women drivers on board and empower them financially</strong>.  Of course, there have been many other  but smaller initiatives such as She Cabs in Hyderabad, She Taxi in Kerala, Women Cabs in Bengaluru, Priyadarshini cabs and Viira Cabs in Mumbai, but these women-only companies find it a tough going due to lack of funding.</p>
<p>Both Ola Cabs and Uber had proposed the idea of women-driven taxis across India after the horrific rape case in Delhi in December 2014. but today, even after nearly 6 years there is<strong> no significant visibility of women in commercial driving in India</strong>. There are talented and deserving women who can easily make a career out of commercial driving. All they need is a signal from Ola Cabs and Uber to show that these workplaces are conducive to their dreams. </p>
<p><strong>Please sign my petition and take the first step to make the dream of seeing more women become cab drivers and autorickshaw drivers, turn into a reality by asking Ola Cabs and Uber to commit to training and inducting 200 women in Mumbai as commercial cab drivers by Women’s Day, 2020. #Cabs4Her<br></strong><br>(Photograph of Sunita Kanse, an autorickshaw driver from Mumbai whom I interviewed as part of my campaign.

Who is supposed to take care of our eyes? My father is an optometrist. He is the guardian of our eyes as a primary eye care practitioner. After years of practicing optometry, he finds himself in a state of helplessness. WHY?!?! Even after 73 years of freedom, his profession does not have a legal stamp of a council from our government. Even after years of existence of the ministries of higher education, the universities are finding loopholes in the system and engaging in unethical collaborations with industries for short term gains. Are 1.3 billion pairs of Indian eyes still at the mercy of the unethical systems and collaborations? Are we not going to wake up to these misadventures of our universities and the people in power? Will we allow the nexus of inapt education system and industries get the better of our basic right to having healthy eyes? It is not only universities, but corporates too have also got into short term training courses for rural areas with the excuse of poor accessibility. Does it mean that rural India will get inappropriate care than a person living in city?? IS IT NOT UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE: meaning all get the same standard care?? Please sign my petition to the HRD ministry and UGC to rectify the system and stop unethical collaborations between universities and industries and to stop all short term certificate courses run by corporates.</p>
<p>Optometrists are the primary eye care professionals and are the first line of defence in eyecare across the world. They are the first professionals who examine our eyes, diagnose the problems, provide appropriate management, and if required, refer them to other professionals for further management and treatment. This requires a stringent university level education for a minimum of 4 years and further specializations. Minimum standards of curriculum, infra structure, faculty – student – equipment ratios etc are all in place. However, certain universities are able to find loopholes in the systems and circumvent the set norms for short term gains. They are doing the biggest disservice to our nation and the people of India at large. Graduates thus produced will be ill trained to take care of our eyes and will be extremely dangerous to the society.</p>
<p>Recently, Chitkara university (a prestigious private university) in Punjab, entered into an industry academia collaboration with a spectacle chain. The reason for this collaboration is obvious. Students of this program will spend most of their years of education in the spectacle outlets of the industry partner and fulfil their manpower requirements. Optometry being a branch of medical system requires the students to be trained in eyecare hospitals and speciality clinics for most part of their education. At least 3 years of their education requires clinical exposure in facilities which can train them to detect, diagnose and manage any eye related ailment and their systemic manifestations. This stringent clinical training is just not possible in an optical outlet.</p>
<p>Please sign my petition to the HRD ministry and UGC and stop such collaborations which will be detrimental to the eyes and vision of my fellow Indians. Support my petition to save my father and thousands of optometrists like him from helplessness. They are required to guide the vision of India for generations to come.</p>

<p>Unadvised by any ""panel of independent, internationally recognized environmental specialists"", the PRR project violates JICA's own Guidelines for Environmental and Social Considerations.</p>
<p>As the project has failed to obtain public consent through a ""free, prior and informed consultation"", it violates JICA's established procedure on inviting opinions/objections of the public.</p>
<p>With neither the mandatory Detailed Project Report nor the blueprints of the PRR's final alignment available to the public, this project also violates JICA's established procedure on Information Disclosure.</p>
<p>All this makes the project inconsistent not only with JICA's commitment and actions towards achieving Sustainable Development Goals, but also the Social and Environmental Safeguard Policies laid down by the World Bank and the ADB.</p>
<p>In addition, there is the small matter of project costs escalating over 36 times in 16 years.</p>
<p>Even if you set aside these irregularities as the cost of doing business in India, the PRR will <em>not</em> solve Bangalore's traffic congestion -- JICA's previous experience with building the Chennai PRR attests to this, as does a mounting body of work around the <a href=""wired.com/2014/06/wuwt-traffic-induced-demand"" rel=""nofollow"">Law of Induced Demand</a>.</p>

Remember your answer for my next question is yet to come.</p>
<p>If you seek specialist treatment from a hospital regarding cancer, would it not be right to have all the specialists in oncology to treat you? The healthcare team consists of doctors, nurses, technicians, pharmacists, hospital and sanitation attendants. For quality care to be given, all the individuals in the particular unit should be specialized in that field of work. I will, however, tell you the grim reality. Nurses who have earned their Masters in a specific discipline are actually not posted in the unit of the same specialty. Instead, they are posted wherever the vacancy is present. This leads to non utilization of human resource and a sheer wastage of all the specific knowledge acquired in the masters degree which in turn deflects back to the quality of care provided to the patients. Also, it deteriorates the morale of the nurse himself/herself, knowing that the masters degree earned can not be put into practise.</p>
<p>My petition is straightforward, to recruit nurses in units according to their specialization, if they have any. This is in the best interests of the healthcare workforce, patients, institutions and the country. </p>

<p>For someone born with a <strong>kidney disorder</strong>, there is a constant fear of using a public toilet. Where will I find a safe, decent toilet? Will the facility be clean? <strong>Why is my mobility outside home restricted by a toilet? </strong></p>
<p><strong>This has been the story of my life for more than 25 years.</strong> Imagine the state of a basti or a jhuggi jhopri cluster, where the urban poor has to think twice before relieving- at all times of the day? </p>
<p><strong>I work as an urban planner, and I understand the immense issues that are attached to the lack of facilities.</strong> Open defecation is not a local problem. It affects us all- via the air we breathe or even the water we drink. The lack of sanitation is responsible for the deaths of over 100,000 children in India annually (UNICEF). <strong>These numbers are shocking, to say the least. </strong></p>
<p><strong><em>“Over 9 crore toilets have been constructed across India,” said the Hon’ble President of India on January 31, 2019.</em></strong></p>
<p>While being Open Defecation Free falls under the Swachh Bharat Mission, and is a Sustainable Development Goal, have we in India really achieved this?</p>
<p>As a Delhi resident, it shocked me to hear that the “usability of public toilets has increased by more than 400% in the last two years” (Deputy CM Manish Sisodia). This is <strong>such a contrast to what the ground reality is</strong> - 70% of public toilets in the city are not clean enough to be used (ActionAid). </p>
<p><strong>Which is why I am asking the Delhi Government to conduct an audit on the usability of the toilets. <a href=""https://www.change.org/p/satyendarjain-msisodia-delhi-government-how-usable-are-your-public-toilets-audit-check-swachhdelhi4all/sign-now"" rel=""nofollow"">Sign my petition.</a></strong></p>
<p>The reality on the ground? <strong>Inhabitants of jhuggi jhopri are defecating in open throughout the day or at least once a day, irrespective of the provision of facilities.</strong> Incidences of physical and sexual harassment are common. Children have lost limbs while crossing roads, railway lines, or drowned in drains. </p>
<p>Is open defecation a way of living for the poor? No! <br>Is it their survival instinct? Definitely!</p>
<p><strong>While we are working towards creating an open defecation free India, is Delhi really setting a good precedent for the rest of India? We need an audit check!</strong> Join me in asking the Delhi government to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Audit check toilets of jhuggi jhopri clusters of Delhi for their USABILITY (not mere provision) before October 2, 2019</li>
<li>Identify the hotspots- <br>a. jhuggi jhopri clusters where despite provision people are defecating in the open<br>b. Clusters where facilities are still not provided </li>
<li>Identify the specific reasons for non-usage or limited usage</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>On October 2, 2019, India was declared open defecation free. But, are we? NO! </strong></p>

<li>Vizag Steel Plant provides livelihood to about 33,000 persons directly, another 40,000 persons are depending on the steel plant in the allied activities. This not to mention the economies of agglomeration since Steel Plant is like a mini-city in itself.</li>
<li>Steel-making is considered a strategic sector by the same government which approved Vizag Steel's privatization.</li>
<li>Vizag Steel Plant became a reality only after the 'Visakha Ukku Andhrula Hakku' agitation that shook Andhra Pradesh. 32 persons sacrificed their lives, 64 villages were evacuated and 22,000 acres of land were sacrificed to build this gigantic steel plant.</li>

<p>To understand the detailed, practical reasoning why Vizag Steel Plant must not be privatized, please read this <a href=""https://theprint.in/opinion/vajpayee-turned-around-the-fortunes-of-vizag-steel-plant-so-can-modi-stop-privatisation/604983/"" rel=""nofollow"">article.</a></p>
<p><strong>What is the solution?</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>As a first step, the Government of Andhra Pradesh must pass a resolution in the Andhra Pradesh Assembly demanding that the Union Cabinet decision to privatize Vizag Steel Plant be taken back. When the state government in power passes such a resolution, it adds further legitimacy to the protests and helps to put pressure on the Center.</li>
<li>Next, the Central Government must take back the decision to privatize Vizag Steel Plant and follow the example of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. As Prime Minister, instead of privatizing VSP, he focused on reviving it. Vizag Steel Plant actually turned around and even became debt-free by repaying all long-term debts in 2003-04. We ask the Central Government to adopt this approach and fulfill the long-pending demand of allocating captive mines immediately.</li>

<p>And recently, I watched a video in which an alive cat was fired by a man. It was a painful and shameless thing to treat an animals in this way. That cat may be so agonised. They can’t speak, that doesn’t mean that we can torture them According to our own will. “They can’t speak but their eyes and soul speaks louder than their voice”.So we need to become their voice. <br>People who abuse animals are cowardly-they take their issues out on the most defenceless victims available- and their cruelty often crosses species lines. Research in psychology and criminology shows that animal abusers tend to repeat their crimes as well as commit similar offenses against member of their own species. For everyone’s safety, it’s vital for law enforcement officials and communities to treat cases of cruelty to animals seriously and to ensure that animal abuser’s are appropriately prosecuted and sentenced. <br>It’s easy to feel despair when we hear about people who deliberately maim, torture or kill animals.

Then CBSE board exams in July may risk the lives of thousands of students in India. So the question to parents is, that are you all really ready to risk your children's lives to just write exams. The question to the government is, are you all really that confident that we wont be exposed to the deadly virus. Or do you give insurance to all the children and their family members. If not, then why do you think that you have the power to decide our future if you cannot guarantee our safety. Carrying mask and sanitizers is not enough to keep us safe, we all know that very well by now. Just take Israel for example, they did open their schools, but what happened? Why did they close again?. As you all know they had some pretty serious cases in just few days. And for that reason they had to shut it down again.

"115",2021-02-23 23:31:06,"Make Migraine Medications Available To Nova Scotians!","<p>Dear Minister Randy Delorey and Minister Kelly Regan,</p>
<p>I am writing to you to address Migraine Disease as an urgent women’s issue in Canada that is being stigmatized and neglected, causing a crisis in women’s health. Migraine is a genetic neurological disease affecting 4.5 million Canadians. It disproportionately affects women, in fact women are three times more likely to experience migraine attacks than men. Chronic Migraine describes people living with 15 <em>or more</em> migraine days a month — imagine having a migraine for more than 50% of your waking hours. As many as 760,000 Canadians live with Chronic Migraine and 85% of those people are women. (<a href=""http://www.headachesociety.ca"" rel=""nofollow"">headachesociety.ca</a>)</p>
<p>Migraine is an extremely debilitating neurological disease. It typically involves a throbbing headache lasting anywhere from 4–72 hours or longer, along with a host of other symptoms including nausea, vertigo, visual aura, light sensitivity and sound sensitivity. The World Health Organization (WHO) states that the disabling effects of severe migraine are “comparable to dementia, quadriplegia and active psychosis” (<a href=""https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-2982.2007.01396.x"" rel=""nofollow"">Shapiro RE, Goadsby PJ, Cephalalgia 2007</a>).<strong> Furthermore, the WHO classified the constant nature of chronic migraine as “more disabling than blindness, paraplegia, angina or rheumatoid arthritis.” </strong>(<a href=""https://www.change.org/p/Harwood%20RH%20et%20al.,%20Bull,%20World%20Health%20Org.%202004"" rel=""nofollow"">Harwood RH et al., Bull, World Health Org. 2004</a>).</p>
<p>Migraine disease affects women differently than men, and because of the large representation of impacted women, it has become viewed as a “feminized illness.” This results in it being under-diagnosed and under-treated. Women are more likely than men to have longer and more intense migraine attacks and report more of an impact on their day-to-day functioning and life. Sadly, the greatest prevalence of migraine disease occurs between the ages of 30–39; this is precisely the time when many women are establishing careers, building families and balancing social obligations. (<a href=""http://www.practicalpainmanagement.com"" rel=""nofollow"">practicalpainmanagement.com</a>)</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are many gender biases evident in healthcare and medical settings. In recent years, studies show that men and women are treated differently for the same diseases, without medical cause and across a variety of different medical fields including psoriasis, heart disease, and particularly chronic pain. (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"" rel=""nofollow"">ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>) Furthermore, women are far more likely to have their pain treated as though it is psychogenic rather than physiological: a recent study showed that “women in pain <em>are much more likely</em> than men to receive prescriptions for sedatives, rather than pain medication, for their ailments” and only half as likely as men to receive painkillers for the<em> same surgical procedure</em>. (<a href=""http://www.health.harvard.edu"" rel=""nofollow"">health.harvard.edu</a>) This particular bias can be traced back to the 19th century when women were routinely labeled as having hysteria to describe a whole host of serious medical conditions. Many women living with chronic migraine are routinely dismissed, told they are exaggerating their pain, not given a proper diagnosis, and demeaned. (<a href=""http://www.painnewsnetwork.org"" rel=""nofollow"">painnewsnetwork.org</a>)</p>
<p>Migraine is an invisible illness and as such has been largely ignored. There are very few medications in Canada that adequately treat this disease. The first effective acute medications, known as triptans, were developed in 1993.<strong> Finally, in 2018, drugs designed specifically to prevent migraine, called anti-CGRP drugs, were introduced to Canada. These drugs have changed many lives.</strong> People who had lived with this disease for years are suddenly able to care for their children, return to work and improve their quality of life. However, these drugs are cost-prohibitive for most people as they cost in the range of $9,000 per year.</p>
<p>Without this drug, many women living with chronic migraine will have NO alternative and NO quality of life. We will not be productive members of society, we will not be contributing to the GDP, and we will continue to frequent ER departments when we need to break intractable migraines (unresponsive to medications and lasting longer than 72 hours straight), putting undue stress on our healthcare system. </p>
<p>The financial costs of this unaddressed disability include not only the loss of one’s income, but also the incredibly high costs of treatments and medications. In the Canadian economy, migraine is the third most costly disease, after back pain and mood disorders, and accounted for $198 million in productivity loss. (<a href=""https://migrainecanada.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Zhang_disability_Canada.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">Zhang, 2016</a>) A study in The Canadian Journal of Neurological Sciences calculated that seven million workdays were lost annually in Canada as a result of migraine (<a href=""https://www.headachesociety.ca"" rel=""nofollow"">headachesociety.ca</a>)</p>
<p><strong>We are asking that this drug class, called anti-CGRPs, and specifically Erenumab (Aimovig) be put onto the Provincial Drug Formulary as soon as possible so that Canadian women can regain control of our lives.</strong></p>

In recognition to their selfless services many other states like UP, Haryana , Rajasthan and others have exempted the members of armed forces from payment of stamp duties while they purchase residential houses.  However soldiers from our Maharashtra state are not getting this exemption. The same exemption can be waived by passing a legislation  in the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly. It's our collective humble request to Hon'ble Chief Minister to amend the relevant Acts for at least 50% exemption from stamp duties while purchasing residential property. This act of benevolence shall go a long way in boosting the morale of soldiers from this great state of Maharashtra.</p>

<p>But for the 28 lakh people living in the city who cannot afford private healthcare the civil hospital does not have paediatric anaesthesia services and paediatric ICU. No child below 10 can be operated in Gurgaon! All children needing any surgery have to be referred to Delhi or Jhajjar/Rohtak.</p>
<p>The commonest surgeries in children include tonsillectomy, adenoidectomy, grommets, tympanoplasty, appendicectomy, intestinal obstruction, cleft lip,cleft palate repair, squint correction and trauma.</p>
<p>Disease does not discriminate between rich and poor. We need to strengthen local health system so that poor people don't spend time traveling back and forth to other cities for health related issues. Every day they don't work, they lose their ""dihadi"" and that effects their family budget and directly the nutrition requirements of their children. India is 102 out of 117 on the global health index, and health related issues are a major cause of debt in the lower income groups.</p>
<p>Dear Health minister Mr Anil Vij please sanction funds, organise doctors and equipment in Civil hospital/General hospital Sector 10 with immediate effect so this can be rectified.</p>
<p>Considering that Gurgaon generates almost 70% of revenue for Haryana state, the people of Gurgaon especially the poor, migrants, working class, not covered by private insurance or Ayushmann Bharat scheme must have access to free and quality healthcare locally.</p>

It's because we all live in cities and towns and aren't aware about the issues girls from smaller towns or villages are facing. This year on our independence Day our prime minister Mr. Narendra Modi announced that they might increase the age of marriage . After this announcement the whole social media was on a buzz with people having different opinions . But because you don't the situation of girls who are married early or because you don't know their condition or you are not facing the same situation you just can't oppose it. Even a lot of big personalities and politicians have opposed it. And still there no statement from the government about it  .</p>

And while we acknowledge and applaud the police team that investigated successfully the complaint relating to the missing baby of Arshiya, barely a day after her delivery and restoring the baby to the distraught mother, this shocking incident causes several concerns about the safety of the system.</p>
<p>Vani Vilas renders yeoman services to the people of Bangalore by providing a haven for women to deliver, free of cost, their babies. It is a service used by hundreds of poor, vulnerable women irrespective of caste or creed. A rough estimate is that on average about 100 deliveries before Covid and 60-70 after Covid occur on a day. Indeed a phenomenal service!</p>
<p>Yet, it is absolutely imperative that we focus on the functioning of the hospital: its infrastructure, the systems and security measures, etc. For instance, what is the right number of CCTV cameras required and how can it be tolerated that of the 12 CCTV cameras installed 10 were not functioning? The hospital, which is open 24/7 to attend to mothers, throughout the day, is a maze of pregnant women, attendants, relatives, visitors, etc. It is difficult to distinguish between genuine patients, genuine relatives and friends and those that ramble/roam around with the intent of finding an opportunity to steal a baby or interchange/swap a girl baby with a boy baby, and then if caught, passing it off as a 'mistaken identity'. These sordid/sleazy happenings are frequently reported, but what are the systems put in place to prevent them? Another question is, what is the quality of the security measures and how sufficient and how efficient are the security personnel? In the present case of the missing child, only 2 CCTV cameras out of 12 were functional. This footage shows the abductor casually/cooly exiting with the baby. Should not procedures be there in place to monitor the 'real mother with her baby' so that the fake ones are weeded out?</p>
<p>It is in this context that the news item ""police issue notice to Vani Vilas hospital over security lapses"" in The Hindu, Sunday, November 22, 2020, is a step in the right direction and must be followed up until proper preventive and effective systems with an element of accountability put in place. Please sign and endorse this petition to demand safer hospital spaces to prevent the abduction and subsequent selling of little babies. Every voice counts!</p>","active"

<p>We would like to bring your attention towards the professional Yoga Teachers and studio owners conveying their hardship during this extension of lockdown. More than starting a alcohol bar for increasing the state and central economy it is also very important to be aware that Yoga is a great tool to help improve respiratory health and immunity, both of which are involved in the prevention and healing from COVID-19. Even our beloved PM calls ""Yoga is good for community, immunity and unity"".</p>
<p>Hence it’s time to urged the government for giving relaxation for the yoga studios except the containment zone, that will help mitigate hardships faced by the yoga teachers. Even today, containing the spread of the virus remains the country's priority. But we also have to take into account that the Fitness and Yoga industry employs many lakhs of people. They are relying for their survival. Every lockdown extension is making it difficult for us to keep people employed, pay the rents and to sustain. Even one of the senior yoga teacher called us yesterday and cried that he is not able to feed two times of happy meal for his family and he is not able to pay his rent. Some how for time being we group of yoga teachers have helped him. But if this situation continue thousands of people who completely depend on yoga and fitness industry will be on street without anything.</p>
<p>Since the government has relaxed operations for several industries including the Bar to keep the wheels of economy moving, we are hoping that it allows Yoga studios some relaxation too. we will promise to take all necessary measures to keep the hygiene and social distance in studio.</p>
<p>Kindly Sign and share this Petition until it reaches the PMO, and concerned Ministry so that they will give some relaxation for yoga and fitness industry to start immediately. </p>

Students were affected with the virus while writing the preparatory 1 and 2 (preparatory exams before the actual board exams).So how on Earth are they supposed to write a month long of exams while the second wave is at its peak without getting affected by the virus. Students affected would not even, hence get a chance to complete rest of their exams . Isn't that unfair ,given that college admissions are taken based on Board marks, which includes the marks pertaining to all subjects as a whole. Its clear injustice. What fault would the student have in this case.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Online classes that happened in these months, were not helpful, doubts were not solved. There was no interaction with the teachers whatsoever. Trying to reach teachers was like a big piece of task. Teachers were finding it so difficult to contact us although they were trying their best. The lack of fast internet supply and the chunky salary cut, did not allow them to do the best they could do, due to the lack of amenities. Despite the huge ICSE syllabus chunk, which was hardly reduced for the year of havoc, studentS kept their silence and followed on. But now is the time to act. Health and Life is no joke.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Also, none of the practical measures are being followed at schools. Social Distancing is not maintained, no sanitization and no wearing of masks by the students as well as the staff. The school managements do not even seem to care. The situation is taken for granted. I know how dangerous the virus is ,cause I've seen it first hand when my parents and my brother were suffering while they were affected by it. I used to be depressed every day thinking about them, while I was at home taking care of my grandparents and my little brother. It was very hard. Thankfully they came out of it ,but ,after so much suffering and loaded medical expenses. I having, a condition called allergic asthma ,and I know how hard it gets when you just have a cold, it's difficult to breath, with chest pains and bouts of coughing. With covid, it's going to be much worse for people like me and also for the general public.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>At last, I'd like to say boards are not that important than health and lives. Everyone deserves to live. Everyone wants to fulfil their aspirations and dreams ,but without life and good health , there's no chance of it happening. THUS,I URGE ALL OF YOU TO SUPPORT THIS PETITION FOR THE FUTURE OF INDIA. Covid cases were comparatively very very very very very less last year and the exams were cancelled. My dad being a doctor and the head of the SICU of the hospital he works in ,has seen it first hand. Everyday he sees patients suffering, families crying and children dying. ITS THAT SERIOUS. We also are given to know that inoculation does not prevent infection like we think it does, so it's not going to withold the virus. It's more worse this year, and we will not only need cancelation of exams But also ANOTHER LOCKDOWN. ITS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY. INDIA IS NOT INDIA WITHOUT ITS CITIZENS .WE NEED PROTECTION. WE CANT LIVE OUR LIVES WITH FEAR.PLEASE FIND A WAY TO CANCEL THE EXAMS COMPLETELY AND PASSING ALL THE STUDENTS EQUALLY FOR NOT ONLY ICSE BUT ALL BOARDS OR HAVING A NON-LIFE IMPACTING SERIES OF EXAMS,OR COUNT MARKS BASED ON PROJECTS.PLEASE DONT PUT TENDER LIVES INTO RISK.PLEASE.PLEASE SIGN THIS.

Little did he know he was not meant to fly. He sniffed everything he came across, excerize his teeth on whatever chewable things he had access to ranging from all kind of shoes. Very keen on expressing his superiority he happily peed to mark his territory, to shoo the other dogs out with his barking who trespassed his territory. But amongst all this, the most loved action was the consistent wagging of his tail whenever he saw his human family. But, his human family thought in other ways. They wanted him to be trained in a human way. So they put him in a training Institution named National School for Dogs in Garchuk, Guwahati, Assam, India. From the very first day onward, Zeus failed to take a liking to the place. He was caged for almost twenty four hours, did not have enough space to run or do his favorite things which he enjoyed at his home. The master always rebuked him with a stick from outside his cage which made him angry enough to bark at him. He couldn't even protect himself. He was all alone there without his family who was supposed to protect him. He was beaten almost regularly in the name of so called training. He stayed there for two months and finally gave up silently without knowing why his dearest family were keen on keeping him in that horrible place when he knew everything which mother nature had already taught him. He knew how to wag his tail, he knew how to show his love for his family although he didn't know the human language to express his love for them. He died there silently...the only way to freedom from the everyday torture and lamentations he had to face while he was alive.</p>
<p>But would it be fair for the man to be free who tortured him so much, for him to be able to enjoy this beautiful world?</p>

Chaotic urban arrangement and overpopulation of the humans <br>have already led to equally enormous population of stray dogs in <br>majority of places in the world. The number of stray dogs in India is huge. According to census-2012 it was about 17.13 million stray dogs. Another estimate as of 2018, the population of stray dogs in India is around 30-35 million. India has more than 30 million stray dogs with more than 20,000 people dying of rabies every year.</p>
<p>There are numerous common problems that can be <br>caused by stray dogs, and here are some of them:</p>
<p>• A dog that is out on its own can cause a collision when it runs in the road, which <br>might even result in injury to other people and also to itself.<br>• Stray dogs tend to defile and sully due to the fact that no one is available to look <br>after it.<br>• All the dogs are not gracious towards human beings and so there are chances that someone might get bitten if the stray dog is not controlled.<br>• Stray dogs often prefer to roam in packs and so it might cause a threatening feel and also result in superfluous and redundant puppies.<br>• Stray dogs tend to bark and howl, especially when they are involved in a fight with <br>another dog which regularly and perpetually happens during mating.</p>
<p>• Strays often live under buildings, decks, sheds, and spread fleas there. Or <br>worse, they a stray dog might discover something to consume, which might <br>cause illness to it, and it'll die under a structure, and cause a horrible rotting <br>odour.<br>• Stray dogs might develop the liking to hunt and might ramble into a garden of <br>other people and might even cause harm to home pets such as guinea pigs and <br>rabbits.<br>• Stray dogs are fond of opening garbage bin bags and so they can cause garbage <br>and refuse to be scattered all over the property or street.<br>• When a stray dog meanders into a farm land and causes harm to livestock, there <br>are chances that the farmer might shoot at it, since they are allowed to do so.</p>","victory"
"157",2021-02-16 06:55:21,"JLL India: Stray dogs must get freedom in DLF Capital Green, Moti Nagar, West Delhi","<p>Strays animals, like dogs, cats in gated societies are the ones that face a lot of problems in their small life, residents and guards hit them, tease them, make them run away if they are resting, residents sometimes command their pet dogs to attack on these strays And there are few people who come forward for them, to feed them to pet them and show love to them. Same is been happening here in DLF Capital Green, Moti Nagar, West Delhi. There are around 26 stray dogs here in the society, scattered in different areas, and some of them are too friendly, some are bit aggressive for their territory. In last few days I was observing most of the residents are planning and plotting against these strays and demanding JLL to move these dogs out of society and make a Stray Free society. Their biggest concern is 2 dog bite attacks last week. Due to which JLL started catching all these strays and confining them at one place, by tying them with plants using chains and just feeding them one time(also to add just spending Rs 500 to Rs 600 to feed 26 stray dogs) and there's no one to take them for a walk, to pee or poop, they are just tied to same place. And this kind of environment for strays is not a solution, but may lead to bigger problems because this will make them more aggressive and they might never trust any human again.</p>
<p>Before these dog bite attack happed last week, people/residents were still making their(stray's) life difficult in society, by scaring them, making them run off, commanding pets to attack on these strays, hitting them(sometimes use kids to do this), not letting anyone feed them, even one incident happed where JLL had appointed a person just to feed these strays, and when he's feeding, someone(a resident) came, snatched and threw that dog food away and scolded him for feeding a hungry stray, and JLL had not said a word on this. And all these things will eventually lead to aggression in any dog and that's the main reason behind the attacks which is the best suited for quote ""jaisi karni waisi bharni"". We(few people who tries to feed them, pet them)also face harassment from other residents for caring for these homeless pooches. The ones with power to fix the situation, JLL was also many times notified for these things happening, and they didn'ttook any step to help us or to make life batter for all of us, so that both residents and animals can live peacefully.</p>
<p>There are many solutions for these situation, but confining strays, tying them with chains, making them suffer by not letting them roam freely(no dog can pee or poop, where they are tied) which is painful for them, and making this situation even worse. Also to mention no gated society or RWA can relocate any stray and that's illegal, but JLL seems to not care about these laws, they just wanted to move all these dogs out of the society under pressure from residents and make a Stray Free Society.</p>
<p>The solution for this situation is when JLL free all the confined stray dogs to their original area in the society and collaborate with all the residents by teaching them how to co-exist, and to feed these strays and stopping any harm on them by other residents also appoint a Dog behaviour expert to understand and fix it for stray dogs, this way, stray dogs will get friendly and playful, and no resident will also frrl safe and happy in this co-existence. Also to add, JLL must take responsibility of vaccinating these stray dogs in society.   </p>
<p>I had tried my best by raising all these to JLL but they are not ready to reason on this, they had made up their mind, which causing a lot of suffering for stray dogs. And to end this suffering, I request for your support, if you feel like these stray dogs don't need to suffer this way, and deserve to live freely and happily with safety . And to make an example of this situation so that this kind of situation won't happen again in any gated society.</p>","victory"

The only relief this densely packed city has are, Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP) and Aarey Forest. These lush green oases in a sea of grey, not only tackle pollution and floods but also help bring down temperatures.</p>
<p>But unfortunately Mumbai stands to lose this forest due to various upcoming projects.</p>
<p>The first of these, which will open up this green lung to commercialization, is a car shed for the upcoming Mumbai Metro 3, which is being funded by the Japanese company, Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) with 57% of the project cost , which is about  2,036 Million $.  A car shed is nothing but a parking lot and service area for metro trains.</p>
<p><strong>JICA</strong></p>
<p>Dear reader, in this day and age when the world is struggling with the devastating consequences of climate change, destroying a critical green lung for a parking lot is irresponsible.</p>
<p>3500 trees are set to be cut and we want the government to rethink the location of the car shed.<br>There are many viable options, mentioned in their own studies, which have no environmental destruction involved.<br>Experts from NEERI and IIT (Reputed organizations in India) have suggested 7 other alternate sites as  options.<br>They have clearly warned of the consequences Mumbai will face in terms of flooding and loss of open space &amp; wildlife, if the depot is built in Aarey forest.<br>Government records show that Aarey is an integral part of Sanjay gandhi National Park and thus protected under forest laws. It has over 5 Lakh trees, it is home to 9 resident leopards and has a rich biodiversity of flora and fauna. Even today, original adivasis (indigenous inhabitants of this area) live in 27 tribal hamlets in Aarey. It offers a unique experience for urban dwellers to experience nature at it's best. “In the name of development, only tribals suffer” said one of the leaders. The Save Aarey campaign has been requesting the government to relocate the carshed to an alternative location. Relocation will not affect the metro 3 alignment in any way. Common citizens from all walks of life, professionals, students, school children, celebrities have  supported this issue.</p>
<p>Inspite of all this the state government is insistent on building the depot in Aarey.</p>
<p>And to support this, they have given wrong information to JICA. The Mumbai Metro rail corporation Ltd.(MMRCL) has told JICA that the project site is located in city area and no wildlife is envisaged, while in reality, Aarey is a forest area , housing 76 species of birds, 80 species of butterflies , 16 species of mammals, 38 species of reptiles and 9 leopards, besides 0.4 million trees.</p>
<p><br> By signing this petition, you are asking JICA to review the funding given to the project. According to JICA's environmental and social considerations, it should comment on the issue and By shifting the depot out of Aarey, Mumbai will not only get a metro but also retain its green, open space. And we are sure in consideration of its policies, JICA will also help in putting an end to further loss of land in Aarey to various other big and small projects.</p>

<p><strong>Schools are slowly opening their doors again, and they must operate within hygienic measures. But what does that mean?</strong><br>The COVID-19 pandemic presents an unprecedented risk to children’s education and wellbeing. Hygiene interventions play an important role in reducing and preventing the spread of the COVID-19 virus and in developing the necessary knowledge for positively impact attitudes of personal and school hygiene practices for students.</p>
<p>In Government schools, toilet conditions are so bad that students, especially girls, try to avoid the toilets on menstruation days. It is no secret that the absence of clean toilets results in girls dropping out of school.</p>
<p>But there is a major gap in government schools in Karnataka. <strong>The government, specifically the Rashtriya Madhyamika Shiksha (RMSA) allocates as little as 25,000 and 15000 per school annually based on type of school and strength of students  for overall maintenance. This means a school gets as little as Rs less than  2,000 for all costs including painting, electricity, printing, internet charge, repairs, and toilet maintenance. This is far from feasible, and as records reflect, this creates a situation where schools are forced to prioritize all other expenses, leaving the toilets on the back burner. Given the prioritization process, often only teacher’s toilets are maintained and these are kept under lock and key. </strong><br> <br><strong>It is no secret that the absence of toilets results in girls dropping out of school. The dropout ratio is the highest in the age group of 11-13 when most girls hit puberty and the need for a clean, hygienic bathroom is crucial</strong>. The average cost for maintenance of bathrooms for a school - i<strong>ncluding the remuneration for someone to keep it clean is at least Rs. 15,000 a month. </strong><br><strong> </strong><br>India has been lagging significantly on both these issues. The fact that Karnataka’s spending on toilets in schools is abysmal is case in point. </p>
<p><strong>Here I request to  Government are</strong></p>
<p>1. Provide separate sufficient fund for Government school Toilet maintainance That is 15,000 per month per school </p>
<p>2. Provide clean and running water for School toilet</p>

Also, the airport is in expansion mode - which means faster growth in future.</p>
<p>So, what are the means of local travel to and from the Airport in Bengaluru ?</p>
<ul>
<li>The first obvious one is the <strong><em>private cars</em></strong></li>
<li>next are <strong><em>public cabs</em></strong> and</li>
<li>then there are<strong><em> BMTC</em> <em>buses</em></strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any other means ? None, at present. <strong>Everything is road-centric</strong>, and unfortunately from all over Bengaluru, you need to reach the Airport via what is called the Airport Road (or Devanahalli Road). Depending on where you start from, to reach the airport, one needs to spend an average of <strong>over 2 hours</strong> (round-the-clock average of 1 hour from Mekhri Circle to round-the-clock average of 3 hours from say Narayana Hrudayalaya). The number of vehicles converging to the airport from all over Bengaluru is obviously huge. <em><strong>All this traffic is adding to the congestion and pollution on the roads. The stress levels faced by commuters and other ill-effects on health are increasing. Productivity is going down. Commute costs are going up.</strong><br></em></p>
<p>The situation can be improved by providing efficient alternate major modes of transport to the airport. The options are :</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Increase available road lanes</strong> (by further widening, by elevated roads, or by alternate roads). This is not sustainable because it will only lead to increase in dependence on private vehicles and will only shift the problems, at a huge cost.</li>
<li><strong>Namma Metro</strong> - Unfortunately, the snail's pace of work seen until now by BMRCL - which I call BMDCL, on account of consistent Delays - means that an effective Metro service to airport will take at least 5 years from now. No work has started to date on the underground stretch (from Nagavara to Dairy Circle) of the Reach6 Line going to the airport. With only an elevated section from airport to Nagavara, the utility will be limited.</li>
<li><strong>BMTC Buses</strong> - Increasing BMTC Buses to airport can lead to some reduction in vehicular traffic. But BMTC is bleeding - under losses. And there is a limit to which BMTC can make a difference. </li>
<li><strong>Trains to Airport.</strong> This is doable. And quickly too. The rail infrastructure is already there in terms of railway lines from both Yesvantpur (YPR) and Byappanahalli (BYPL) to entrance of the airport near the road to Devanahalli - see the Green Lines in the diagram above. Running trains on these 2 lines - which converge at Yelahanka (YNK) (and proceed to Devanahalli and beyond) specifically for the airport, would lead to drastic reduction in traffic all over Bengaluru - since both these stations are also already having nearby Metro Stations which connect to various parts of Bengaluru. Once these train services stabilise, it will be easy to add further train services which can integrate with Suburban Train System of Bengaluru.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>So, what needs to be done ?</strong> <em>BIAL</em> should take a lead in implementing this solution. <em>State Government</em> must do its part and <em>Central Government (Railways)</em> must do theirs. <strong>If all 3 sit together and take this on a fast track, I firmly believe, we can have trains to airport by mid-2019.</strong></p>
<p>So, my appeal to all Bengalureans and Visitors to Bengaluru is to support my demand for <strong>coordinated efforts on the part of the 2 Governments as well as BIAL to make this practical - and quickly too.</strong></p>","victory"

It left me baffled. I was already apprehensive of what is going to happen when, in a matter of days, I found out about 3 people in India who have been suspected of being affected by this virus.</p>
<p>As per news reports, these three suspected cases of the novel <strong>Coronavirus (2019-nCoV)</strong> have been reported at the <strong>Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) Hospital in Delhi,</strong> where they have been kept in isolation for further treatment. Not only that, <strong>several people in India are under observation for possible exposure to the virus.</strong></p>
<p>The people all over the world are worried due to the spread of this virus at an <strong>alarming rate</strong>. As per the World Health Organisation (WHO), the Coronavirus usually causes respiratory illness, showing symptoms of fever, cough, and breathing difficulties.<strong> The outbreak has caused grave concern as it can even lead to pneumonia, SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), failure of kidney and even turn fatal</strong>. Recently, a Chinese official has confirmed that asymptomatic people, <strong>who do not show any symptom, can also infect others, </strong>making it all the more difficult to control it.</p>
<p>Since no individual is immune to its infection, it will enter India, and thus, its entry and spread into India must be prevented.I urge you to <a href=""https://www.change.org/p/ministry-of-health-family-welfare-declare-red-alert-for-coronavirus-drharshvardhan-mohfw-india/sign-now"" rel=""nofollow""><strong>Sign my petition</strong></a>.</p>

I <em>requested </em>them to stop when they came too close, as I walked in fear that any loud protest will trigger them into action even quicker. In that moment, I felt <em>ashamed </em>at my lack of independence out of concern for my physical safety, with no fault of my own. I was fortunate that I got away, <em>but most people are not.</em></p>
<p>Like me, many <em>women, men, and children</em> are subjected to the risk of stalking, molestation, assault, robbery, and even rape or murder, as they try to go by their daily lives.</p>
<p>According to the National Crime Records Bureau, Delhi consistently tops the crime rate amongst 19 major Indian cities. A survey conducted by an organisation working on safety in the city shows that Delhi has <em>more than <strong>7,400</strong></em><strong> </strong>dark spots. Many areas are poorly lit despite having street lights because they are non-operational, hidden behind trees &amp; sign-boards, or installed only for vehicular traffic. Enhancing illumination is a proven measure of improving citizen safety.</p>
<p>The Delhi Government needs to make our streets <strong>safer and accessible.</strong> The safety of citizens in Delhi has been a consistent topic of conversation since the gruesome rape and murder of a young Nirbhaya in December 2012. Not much has changed since, and the government cannot be let away without accounting for measurable progress.</p>
<p><strong>The Solution</strong>:</p>
<p>The Delhi Metro is the safest mode of public transport in the city. As a primary step towards making a <strong>#SafeDelhi</strong>, we need this safety to extend beyond the station areas: whether we look for further transport from the stations or walk our way to our destinations.</p>
<p>Let us ask the Delhi Government to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prepare a report on the condition of street lighting around key public areas.</li>
<li>Install sustainable solar LED lamps on all walkways/ footpaths in a 1 km radius around all metro stations.</li>
</ul>
<p>I appeal everyone to sign this petition to take this step towards better accessibility, and a sustainable, safer, pedestrian friendly Delhi. Each of us deserves to lead free and happy lives without worrying for the safety of our loved ones’ and our personal safety.

<p>Unruly traffic and potholes on the streets - <strong>there are no separate walkways for pedestrians or pathways for cycles. </strong>Delhi ranks the highest in terms of fatal accidents and in number of pedestrians and cyclists falling victim to road crashes.</p>

<p><strong>This is why, I am asking the Delhi Government to mandate the implementation of proper lanes for cyclists and pedestrians across the city.</strong></p>
<p>Rather than focussing on further infrastructure development to make roads better for cars and trucks, the only way <strong>Delhi can avert a serious mobility and pollution crisis is to scale up public transport along with walking and cycling.</strong></p>

<p>Students have already given their preliminary examinations. Most schools have conducted 2 prelims, some even 3. Now, once again the students are being told to sit for the board exams, which is just mentally and physically draining for the students.</p>
<p>Last year, the students were in a similar situation. There were just a few Covid cases in the country but the council cancelled the remaining papers and took into consideration the prelim marks of the students. Now, India has surpassed Brazil and become the country with highest daily Covid-19 cases IN THE WORLD (as on 5th April 2021). Cities like Mumbai are experiencing their biggest ever daily case surge since the beginning of the pandemic! In such times, the government wishes to conduct board examinations and refuses to accept prelim marks as final marks (as it was done for the previous batch when cases were less). It is unfair to these students who are in a much much worse position than last year's batch if they are asked to write the board exams.</p>

And if they didn't conduct the exam (as the 2nd wave of corona is spreading very quickly and is very dangerous) than they could say us again to wait for a few months by staying in class 10 only . All the students of class 10 of other boards are in std 11 now but students of icse are still in std 10 and still waiting but the question is we're waiting for what ? </p>
<p>We're waiting to give the exams ? Well no icse is not gonna conduct the exams after 1 June too as the corona is spreading in a very huge number and they can't conduct exams in this situation and just wasting our time and future. At this time where we should prepare for the streams we are gonna study after schools they wants us to prepare for class 10 and this effects in our 11th and 12th as we are entering the junior colleges very late just because of the decision taken by icse. ICSE who doesn't care about the health of students of their board . They just care about wasting the time of students. </p>
<p>At the time when other board students like state board or cbse will be giving the exams of 11 th icse will still say us to wait till they conduct the exams of icse boards class 10 th . No words for icse.</p>

It is a threat to us and people near us. When the <strong>classes can be conducted online, why can't the examinations be online</strong> too? Why conduct the examinations offline, when the cases are increasing day by day? Why expose us to threat? It would have a domino effect, as even if just a person (whether the student or the invigilator) contracts the virus will exposes everyone in the examination hall. Now even the family of each and every person in that hall would be at the risk of contracting COVID-19, but also all the others whom they meet.</p>
<p>As already COVID-19's 2nd wave is on a surge, with having more than 1 lakh new cases everyday. We would like to request our dear <strong>Hon'ble</strong> <strong>education minister Shri Ramesh Pokhriyal Sir</strong>, <strong>Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD)</strong>, <strong>UGC</strong> and our <strong>respective college management</strong> to please conduct our final examinations online, for the safety of each and every student and people near us. </p>
<p>When the new cases where less than 1000 per day instead of 1 lakh per day, all the colleges had already adopted online teaching method,  conducting online classes. When the classes can be conducted online, can't our examinations be conducted online too? <strong>If we can adopt to a non-conventional method of teaching, shouldn't the same be done to the method of conducting the evaluation</strong>, by conducting online examinations. It won't put anyone in risk and is a much better solution to conducting examinations online. </p>

Expecting mothers losing their unborn child, young children below 10 years of age facing respiratory and asthmatic health issues- the deteriorating air quality and its far reaching impacts on the most vulnerable are not unknown. Yet, consistent action to combat air pollution on priority is lacking. </p>
<p>Air Pollution is one of the top 5 reasons for death, this silent killer kills 13 people every minute, accounting for more than three times the amount of people who die from malaria, tuberculosis and AIDS combined each year. India is feeling the heat of a pressing crisis due to rising toxicity in the air we breathe. We shouldn’t wait to lose our loved ones in order to take action.</p>
<p>As a citizen, I feel it is my duty to speak out for the sake of my own health, and that of every single person. That is why I have started this petition. </p>
<p>I am also a part of the Bengal Clean Air Network (Bengal-CAN), a network of key stakeholders concerned about the degrading air quality in the State. We have come up with a Clean Air Manifesto for the 2021-2026 period. </p>
<p>Through my petition, I am urging all political parties to address the pressing issue of air pollution in the state by creating state policies and committing to reduce air pollution by 30 percent by 2024 (as targeted by NCAP, of MOEFCC) and include this agenda in their political manifestos. </p>
<p>As citizens, we must urge the political leadership to strongly move in the right direction so that development comes in balance with environmental security. </p>
<p>The following key points are included in the Clean Air Manifesto:</p>
<p>• Develop sustainable mobility plans for Kolkata and other major cities - remove all cycle restrictions, promote trams and Electric Vehicles.</p>
<p>• Mandate waste segregation in all Urban Local Bodies.</p>
<p>• Develop more green corridors and enforce regulations for forest covers and biodiversity corridors.</p>
<p>• Low carbon-footprint lifestyle and Promote environment education in school and college curriculums</p>
<p>• Reduce emissions by 30% of the current air pollution levels by 2024</p>
<p>Kindly show your support by sharing and acknowledging this manifesto and build a sustained dialogue for clean air so that we can build safe breathing spaces for all. I, therefore, request you to sign the petition and help this bold initiative to build strong voices for a sustained future of ours and our children's health. </p>

The country is recording<strong> over 3 Lakh COVID-19 cases per day.</strong> The strains on the healthcare system because of the pandemic is evident to all. The people who are<strong> struggling 24x7 to keep the healthcare system afloat</strong> by providing relentless service in high pressure and high risk conditions are our Doctors and Healthcare workers. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), world over, about<strong> 35% healthcare workers have been infected by COVID-19</strong>, though data availability and quality are limited. Many <strong>doctors and healthcare workers have also lost their lives. </strong></p>
<p>Last Year, in the midst of the Corona-Virus pandemic, the <strong>WHO</strong> called upon governments to address the <strong>persistent threats to the health and safety of the Healthcare workers</strong>. The COVID-19 pandemic has reminded all of us the vital role Healthcare workers play to relieve suffering and to save lives. The pandemic has also highlighted the extent to which protecting doctors and health workers is key to ensuring a well functioning health system. <strong>No country can keep its patients safe unless it keeps its Doctors and Healthcare workers safe!</strong></p>
<p>While the <strong>Doctors and Healthcare workers </strong>help the country fight the pandemic front and center, at the cost of their and their families' health and lives<strong>,</strong> it is shocking that there are <strong>no seats reserved in any hospitals (by the Centre or the State) for treatment of Doctors and Healthcare workers who have been infected by COVID-19.</strong> In fact, in some cases, they are unable to get hospital beds in those very hospitals in which they are serving. This needs to be corrected by the Government immediately. Our Healthcare workers deserve the honour and dignity of <strong>receiving medical treatment at priority</strong> for the noble contribution made by them in treatment and management of COVID-19 patients. If this is not done, the country stands the <strong>risk to lose its indispensable human resources</strong> that are absolutely critical to manage this pandemic. </p>

<li>Gyms are crucial for people leading normal healthy and fit lives</li>
</ul>
<p>Previous lockdown has already dealt a severe blow to the finances of Gym Owners, Gym Building owners, Gym Trainers and Gym Clients pushing them into severe mental and financial hardships, </p>
<p>Restricting this Right to Health and Fitness will have detrimental effects on an individual's quality of life and will have a cascading effect on the economy through increased illnesses and stress related issues leading to heavy health costs in future.</p>
<p>The Solution would be to Restrict clients inflow on an hourly basis, following sanitization protocol and maintaining social distance and as we are in this pandemic situation for the long run, shutting down gyms is not the solution.</p>

I was in my room. I could vaguely hear my dad as he rushed out of the house. Confused, I called him. After a few seconds, he picked up and I realized that he was sobbing. I’d never seen my dad cry. And then, he said something that will haunt me forever – <strong>“Raghav is gone.”</strong></p>

<p>He was my best friend and my idol. He was the kind of person who wanted to help everyone but never asked for anything in return. </p>

According to WHO, suicide is the second leading cause of death among young adults. Data released recently by the online journal Lancet Public Health, as part of its Global Burden of Disease Study (1990 to 2016), revealed, for the first time, the quantum of the problem India is facing: <strong>In 2016, it had the highest number of suicide deaths </strong>and it's only increasing every year.</p>
<p>Another disturbing truth that I came across while doing my research was that most of the suicide helpline numbers do not work. I dialled around 15 numbers but most of the calls went unanswered, some numbers were switched off. <strong>Only three responded.</strong></p>

<p>新型コロナウイルスの感染が拡大するなか、今夏に開催が予定されていた「東京2020オリンピック・パラリンピック」は延期が確定しましたが、その「東京2020」のゴールドパートナーであるアサヒビールを擁する「<strong>アサヒグループホールディングス株式会社</strong>」が、4月6日、動物実験を行わないというポリシーを公式ウェブサイトに公開しました。</p>
<p><a href=""https://rd.asahigroup-holdings.com/research/region/material/#animalExptLink"" rel=""nofollow""><strong>アサヒグループの動物実験に対する基本姿勢</strong></a></p>
<p><em>「アサヒグループは、食品・飲料および化粧品の分野において、法律上明確に義務付けられていない動物実験への資金拠出、動物実験の実施、動物実験の委託は行いません。」</em></p>
<p>このポリシー、本当に信じても大丈夫でしょうか？</p>
<p><strong>■JAVAが2月に面会、ポリシーの除外規定とは</strong></p>
<p>私たち動物実験の廃止を求める会（JAVA：ジャバ）は、2020年2月21日に<strong>アサヒグループの担当者らに面会</strong>した際、廃止の対象外としている「法律上義務付けられている」動物実験について確認したところ、次の3つでした：</p>
<ol>
<li>市販後の事故等、公衆衛生上の説明責任が生じた場合</li>
<li>諸外国の制度上法的要件（EUのNovel Food、アメリカのGRASなど）とされている場合</li>
<li>国に対する各種許可申請、届出等（食品飲料品：消費者庁への特定保健用食品の許可申請、機能性表示食品の届出、化粧品：化粧品基準改正要請、医薬部外品の製造販売承認申請　他）</li>
</ol>
<p>問題は3です。</p>
<p><strong>■トクホと機能性表示食品</strong></p>
<p>いま、食品業界で最も開発が華やかな分野、それが〈特定保健用食品（<strong>トクホ</strong>）〉と〈<strong>機能性表示食品</strong>〉です。この2つは、消費者庁に対して許可申請（トクホ）や届出（機能性表示食品）が必要なのですが、いずれも、<strong>いままで多くの人に食べられてきたものやヒト試験でデータが得られているもので商品開発すれば動物実験を行う必要はありません</strong>。一方、いままで食された経験が少ないものやヒトでのデータがない、新規性のあるものを使って商品を開発しようとするのであれば、安全性データや機能性を示すデータが必要になってくるわけですが、その“オプション”のために「動物実験が法律上義務付けられているので仕方がない」というのが、アサヒグループの言い訳です。</p>
<p>「健康寿命の延伸」という大義名分のもと、いまの食品業界は食べ物に不自然な〈機能性〉を添加して新商品を展開し特許をとって利益を得る、そのために本来不要であるはずの動物実験が行われる、というわけなのです。</p>
<p><strong>■アサヒグループが行ってきた動物実験の一例</strong></p>
<p><a href=""https://www.fld.caa.go.jp/caaks/cssc02/?recordSeq=41904290020501"" rel=""nofollow"">「カラダカルピス」スパークリング　のための毒性試験</a></p>
<p>独自の乳酸菌が体脂肪を減らすという機能を謳う商品。この乳酸菌の反復投与毒性試験として雌雄各6匹のラットに乳酸菌を90日間経口投与。試験後解剖して処分。</p>
<p><a href=""https://rd.asahigroup-holdings.com/research/report/10.html"" rel=""nofollow"">「りんごポリフェノール（AP）」の脂肪蓄積抑制効果に関する研究</a></p>
<p>ラットを用いた給餌実験では、通常エサと高脂肪エサ、高脂肪エサ＋AP、高脂肪エサ＋茶カテキンのグループで10週間飼育。実験後は解剖して睾丸周囲、腎臓周囲、及び腸間膜からなる脂肪組織重量を測定するなどしてのち処分。弘前大学との共同研究。</p>
<p><strong>■他社はやめている</strong></p>
<p>これまでJAVAが動物実験廃止を働きかけた食品企業のうち、<strong>キッコーマン</strong>は、商品の製造過程における安全性や機能性などの確認に限らず基礎研究も含めすべての動物実験を廃止することを確約しました。</p>
<p>当初「トクホの許可申請時に消費者庁から動物実験を要求された場合は行う」としていた<strong>ヤクルト本社</strong>も、私たちからの要望を受け、このケースについても行わないことを書面にて確約しました。</p>
<p>また、<strong>日清食品グループ</strong>は「食経験を優先し、今後もしトクホの新商品を出すことになった場合でも、動物実験ではない方法によるデータで許可申請を行う」</p>
<p><strong>不二製油グループ</strong>は「効能があるかもしれないと考えられる素材や成分の探索のための動物実験がなかなか手放せなかったがこれも廃止に踏み切った」</p>
<p><strong>キユーピー</strong>は「動物実験が必要になるような素材の開発などには踏み込まないような商品設計で進めている」</p>
<p>というように、〈トクホ〉や〈機能性表示食品〉のための動物実験は、形式上「法律上義務付けられた実験」であったとしても、「やらない」というスタンスを明確にしており、<strong>企業努力で回避できる</strong>ことを証明しています。ところが<strong>アサヒグループは、これらの企業が廃止できた動物実験を「廃止の対象外」としています</strong>。したがって、アサヒグループの「動物実験は行わない」というポリシーは不十分であり、私たちはこれを評価することができません。</p>
<p><strong>■5月10日までにご賛同をお願いします！</strong></p>
<p>JAVAは3月24日、アサヒグループ社長あてに「食品・飲料、化粧品、日用品分野における動物実験廃止を求める要望書」しました。この要望書に対する回答期限は5月末です。要望内容など詳しくは<a href=""https://www.java-animal.org/asahi2020/"" rel=""nofollow""><strong>JAVAのウェブサイト</strong></a>をご覧ください。</p>
<p>いま世界中で猛威をふるう新型コロナウイルス。それどころではないというご批判もあるかもしれません。</p>
<p>しかし、この1カ月半の間に、動物実験をきちんと廃止するかどうか、アサヒグループの経営判断が下されます。この期間に「動物実験はやめてほしい」というたくさんの署名が集まれば、経営判断に必ずよい影響を及ぼすはずです。一社でも多くの大企業が動物実験を確実に廃止すれば、それは業界の常識となり、犠牲になる動物が確実に減っていくはずです。</p>
<p><strong>署名の期限は5月10日</strong>としました。どうか、一人でも多くの人にこのキャンペーンにご賛同いただけますようお願いいたします！</p>","victory"

This medical device, implanted in the stomach, will stimulate the nerves that allow the stomach to empty. Laurie's insurance company Premera Blue Cross (via her employer Starbucks) is denying coverage for this device. The device is used to treat an incurable condition called gastroparesis, where the stomach no longer empties regularly, causing nausea, vomiting, and dehydration. Because Laurie has received a kidney-pancreas transplant, a feeding tube is not optional due to the risk of infection.</p>
<p>There are no medications to treat this disease. The constant nausea and frequent vomiting that she experiences as a result of the gastroparesis are making it difficult for her to absorb her transplant medications that prevent rejection of her transplanted organs. Laurie has been admitted to the hospital monthly, sometimes weekly, for IV. hydration and medication that she cannot keep down due to nausea and vomiting.</p>
<p>Premera Blue Cross helped cover the cost of her life-saving transplant, but refuses to cover this device which will keep it from failing. After all that Laurie has endured to stay alive, this is inconceivable, but true.</p>

<p>We sincerely request our honourable Chief Minister of Manipur, Dr. Lorho, MP, Shri. Losii Dikho, PHED, Printing and Stationery, Minister, Shri. N.Kayisii, Tribal and Hill Areas Development, Fisheries, MInister and Shri.DD Thaisii, MLA to install Truenat machine at Senapati District Hospital. </p>
<p>Currently, there are about 1690 returnees in Senapati. With the incoming of stranded citizens, the proper place for institutional quarantining is a matter of great concern. The long days of waiting for the returnees to get their swab test result in the transitional quarantine centres could infect and spread virus within the inmates. It is to mention that most of the villages in Senapati Districts have prepared quarantine centres to host the returnees. Therefore, it is observed that there is an urgent need to speed up the swab test and send returnees with negative results to their village quarantine centre.</p>
<p>We bring to your honourable table the following points signed by more than 1300 citizens in less than 48 hours for your benign urgent perusal and further necessary action. The large number of people signed within a short period of time shows the urgent need to install Truenat machine in the District Hospital, Senapati.</p>
<p>1.         That, we appeal you to urgently set up a Covid19 testing Unit in District Hospital, Senapati starting with TrueNat testing facility to speed up the swab test of those returnees. As the experts opined that the TrueNat Testing machine can be used to test over 30 disease condition including TB, malaria, typhoid, HIV, Covid19 etc. Therefore, taking up this step will be a landmark history of Manipur in particularly for the people of Senapati District.</p>
<p>2.         That, we also appeal you to provide Ambulances to transport the sick patients and other emergency patients to the District Hospital or Imphal.</p>
<p>3.         That, we also appeal you to set up an emergency treatment facility having isolation ward with ICU facilities in the district hospital.</p>
<p>4.         That we also appeal to install TrueNat Testing facilities in all the PHCs of Senapati District.</p>
<p>We pray that the above points 1-3 may be taken up on priority basis pooling in resources from fund such as MLA-LADP, MP-LADS, Disaster Management Relief Fund or from any other fund to meet the immediate needs. We repose our trust that all the points that we have mentioned here through this humble representation will receive your kindest attention and prompt action.</p>
<p>As concerned citizen we are willing to mobilize for crowd funding so as to support the immediate need of the District in our own capacities.</p>

<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Some of the information about Truenat in Senapati District Hospital is given below: </p>
<p>1. Is this TrueNat for testing only Covid19 or can we also use for testing other diseases?</p>
<p>TrueNat actually can test over 30 disease condition including TB (the machine is known for this and is recommended by WHO), H1N1, malaria, influenza, HIV etc. It just needs to change the test kit. The machine will remain the same to test any if these disease conditions.in </p>
<p>2. What is the cost of the Truenat machine?<br>Cost will depend on the size of the machine. The machine is categorized ad Uno, duo and quattro or simple 1, 2 and 4 channel.. according to no. of test done at a time. The price ranges from 5 lacs to 19 lacs. The test kit for COVID19 is about Rs. 1340 each.</p>
<p>3. Which channel machine do our district needs? What's your suggestion?</p>
<p>Immediate need is the 4 channel. So that we can test many people as fast as possible. But the cost may be too high. A two channels machine will be the best for Senapati District Hospital. It is informed that the central govt. has procured many devices that will be distributed to states under NTEP (national TB elimination program)</p>
<p>If our govt. or the district already have the truenat machine, we need to only procure the COVID19 chips. This needs to be established with the TB program officers in the district.</p>
<p>4. How long time it may take to procure this machine?</p>
<p>This is an issue. All the state govts. are after the company molbio diagnostics to sell them the machines. This is the only company that makes the machine and the test kits. The wait time is quite long.</p>
<p>I will have to request the people in the company to expedite the process if we are buying one. But I will be able to approach them only when we are certain to buy one.</p>
<p>5. Do we have the manpower or technicians to run this machine?</p>
<p>The machine is very simple and easy to use. Anyone can actually ran the machine. We certainly have lab technicians in district hospital. With a training for a day, they will be able to use it.</p>
<p>The machine does not require any special environment to function. A strong table to keep the machine os all it needs. It is portable as it is battery operated. Which means it can function even when there is no electricity. Once the electricity is there, the machine will be recharged.</p>
<p>Here we have some basic information about the Truenat and we would like to update more information in case we are going to procure the machine. We need to sensitize our politicians, leaders and the common people about the need to have TrueNat machine in Senapati District Hospital.</p>
<p>No only in Senapati District Hospital, TrueNat machine needs to be installed in all the district hospital and also in all the Primary Health Center and sub-centre</p>
<p>Please share this information with your local politicians, CSO leaders and all the public. It is our common people rights to have some basic medical facilities.</p>

<p>With the total case tally <strong>reaching 3,00,000</strong> and students coming from all the parts of the country(<strong>including containment zones</strong>), it is very risky to conduct examinations.

As if that weren't enough, some of the incompetent officers and officials have a victim-blaming mind set which not only deters cases from being reported but also prevents action from being taken.Victim blaming is the worst traumatic blame that can be give to a survivor it can scar them .</p>
<p>Recently a Woman was gang raped and robbed while she was travelling with her Children via Lahore Sialkot Motorway. Due to some technical issue in her car she had to stop when she encountered Two hideous armed Beasts , they on Gunpoint led the woman and her children to a nearby field where they raped that poor innocent soul in front of her helpless children. In another recent incident a 5-6 year old girl named Marwah was kidnapped in Karachi later on she was brutally raped by grown men and then killed and if that wasn’t enough for those loathsome foul dirty animals they also burned the corpse of the poor soul. </p>
<p>Almost 2 years after the Zainab case , On 7 February 2020, the national assembly of Pakistan passed a resolution calling for public hanging of child molesters. Apparently the resolution is non-binding which means the amendments it proposed are not a part of the constitution yet. The sad part is that opposition leader Bilawal Bhutto Zardari son of the first female PM of Pakistan opposes it if that’s not enough Science Minister Fawad Chaudhry and Minister of Human Rights Pakistan Shireen Mazari also oppose it since public hangings go against some UN laws. Apparently some international organisations deem death penalties and public hangings for rape as very *strict*punishments and want the judiciary to only announce imprisonment sentences.</p>
<p>In Pakistan only 4% offenders of reported rape cases are punished this is mainly due to delay in medical examination of victims which acts as a substantial proof against the offender in the court of law. </p>
<p>In the last two months over 70 rape cases have been reported in Lahore only , it is high time the government took this issue seriously work needs to be done efficient law making need to be done , our constitution does not even properly categorize different types of abuse against woman, let alone punish them . Strict punishments need to be introduced Public hangings of rapists should be carried out people who say that these are too strict punishments for any human beings let me remind them that their is nothing human about sexually harassing a 5 year old girl or a new born baby even animals don’t act like that we need to take a strict solid firm stance against these perverts and paedophiles , we need to show all these criminals that the Islamic Republic of Pakistan isnt afraid to punish child molesters or any type of sexual harasser because only when theyll think about the consequences of committing this grave sin and when they will have fear , they will think twice before committing any such heinous offence .</p>
<p>Moreover i believe that a more long term solution is required too the problem lies in the mind set of the population we need to normalise sex education. IN Nairobi, Kenya middle schoolers were given consent classes .These classes fought misogyny and patriarchy in the younger generation they taught them to treat each other as equals to respect each other and care for each other.As an impact a significant decrease was seen in reported rape cases in Nairobi they fell down to 51% , and the surprising part is that local locals boys intervened and stopped 71% of those assaults this is the power of education. </p>
<p>Lastly id just like to say that we need are a nation and need to look out for each other and care for each other we need to be more expressive and serious on these matters otherwise these matters will worsen. Pakistan Zindabad.</p>","victory"

<p>They are making us fool by sending us an email in which there is written that ₹7000 from previous year's hostel fees will be adjusted in this year. The truth is that they have already increased the fees and added the amount of  ₹7000 in this year's fees.</p>

<p>Due to COVID-19 and announcement made where the whole of the upcoming semester starting from 25th of June will be online. It seems unjustifiable for us to be charged resource fees for no resources.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the value of an online learning experience, as opposed to the physical on-campus experience of learning at VIT BHOPAL, has been put to a standstill due to social distancing, etc, we as students of this institution seek to move the higher management to remove all resource fee costs from our fee payments and waiver a percentage of the tuition fee as well as the hostel fee.</p>
<p>We will negotiate to the best extent and find a middle ground amicably between the students and the management.</p>
<p>Please do not hesitate to share this petition to others for this cause as this is a fundamental right and the management cannot sanction us with any punishment for invoking this right on them by raising this petition.</p>

She was raped in a barbarous way, her tongue cut off and severe damage to the neck and spinal cord due to the rapists’ intentional strangulation with her scarf. No social media outrage, no suspects in custody partially because she was a Dalit (formerly untouchable) who cares about her rape right? The news of the  came to light only after her death, she battled for her life for 14 days and yet no suspects were in custody. After the Nirbhaya rape case, India’s most gruesome rape crime yet, changes to the country's rape laws were made. But there has been no sign of crimes against women and girls abating.</p>
<p>This petition isn’t only for, but for all other women whose rape stories were shut down by deaf ears and for those who weren’t able to push through the justice system to punish the guilty. Rape isn’t a normal crime and its number is only increasing by the day, let’s stop being aberrant to this fact. India is ‘The Top Most Dangerous Country for Women’ and that’s where the line ends. No actions are taken, no one accountable, no change. Is that how this all is supposed to be? One rape case rattles the nation and gradually it moves from the front page to the back page of the newspapers until it is forever forgotten? One mistake of one man ruins the life of the victim. The dilemma, the social stigma, the shock resonates for long enough to completely change the victim inside out, that is only if she is not burned alive or killed by the rapists, or in this case, cut her tongue off. In the year of 2018, when the criminal act of rape was at its all-time high, the government of India proposed the death sentence for accused of the rape of children of 12 years and below, but that proposition was short-lived as many ministers of our ‘PROGRESSIVE INDIA’ believed that rapists deserve a second chance. Giving a second chance to accused of involuntary manslaughter is still understood, but RAPISTS? People whose sexual thoughts are uncontrollable, and solely their sexual arousal is to blame for the crime, shouldn’t get a second chance, fully conscious of their actions, rapists aren’t born, they are made by the very society we live in today. Let’s come together and make sure that capital punishment is given to such inhumane people that we call rapists.</p>
<p>Welcome to India, welcome to the nation where we have round-the-clock monitored borders. And the irony the threat doesn’t only emerge from outside but the threats thrive within our nation. Let’s change this and bring about a safer country for everyone together as human beings for the sake of humanity and human morals.</p>

As a thinking-feeling society, this should completely jar our collective conscience. This was a case that was supposed to be 'fast-tracked'. Her 4 rapists who were pronounced GUILTY and given the death penalty by the Supreme Court in May 2017, are still to be hanged to death. On 7th January 2020, a Delhi Court issued death warrants for all 4 rapists, and they were to be hanged to death on 22nd January 2020 at 7A.M...But that NEVER HAPPENED!</p>
<p>The rapists and their lawyers have been misusing loopholes in the Justice system and delaying their capital punishment. Nirbhaya's mother has been running from pillar to post for justice since 2012. But how much longer??? </p>
<p>This punishment CANNOT and SHOULD NOT be delayed any further than it already has been. Not only is it being viewed by right-minded people in society as a failing of the Indian Justice system, but there could be further serious repercussions. </p>
<p>If we, the citizens of this nation, lose faith in the justice system, then the day might not be far when people of this nation will decide to mete out their own form of 'justice'. Kangaroo courts might start pronouncing judgments, and Telangana-like incidents might become common. The citizens of this nation might start to ACTUALLY BELIEVE that they will not get justice in the right and legal way from a justice system that they respected and put their faith in...but one that has failed them time and again. Is that the road we want to go down? Because that road leads only to anarchy. </p>

Close the door on further appeals; plug the loopholes; amend or repeal the law as the case may be, and uphold the Indian National Motto ""Satyameva Jayate"" (""Truth alone will triumph""). Let the women of this nation and their loved ones feel safe and vindicated. Let us, as a nation, be able to say, ""Justice has been served"". </p>

I want the guilty to be hanged. <em>Every other country has instant death for rape fo guilty and our country has peer pressure of suicidal level for the victim. <strong>Otherwise it's fine if you just want to see any other woman facing the same. Maybe you will feel someday when any of this will happen to your known. I hope it never does but it may if you don't act responsibly.</strong></em> This is just another petetion signed for the rape cases which are stirring up in India. The ones who rape are not taken into custody and instead the victims feel social pressure and public allegations. Another one of these monsterous event took place recently in Hyderabad with Priyanka Reddy who was a veterinary doctor in Kolluru village.</p>
<p>Four people were detained by the Cyberabad police on Friday. They were identified as Mohammad Areef (driver), Jollu Naveen (cleaner), Chennakeshavulu (cleaner), Jollu Shiva (driver).</p>
<p>The police said that the accused who were consuming alcohol at Shamshabad toll plaza saw Priyanka parking her scooter and hatched the plan to rape her. And one of them (Jollu Naveen) punctured the rear wheel of the doctor's scooter which was parked at a place.</p>
<p>The police said that the accused then raped the girl who died because of accused had covered her mouth and nose while committing the crime. The accused then wrapped the dead body in a blanket and took it to Shadnagar and burnt the body.</p>

It's we itself raping dignity of our society, our culture, our country, it's we making our system collapse and paralyze. Just you and only you can change this or continue with the same. A humble request don't register your protest by changing DP, updating victim's story n her painful suffering on 24 hours status just do something which causes change. Court will not going to give judgment on the ground of support on social media and millions of candle post. Just rape this system which isn't condemn such act as inhuman, come on road, boycott the leaders and bring something like referendum. Kindly come and mobilise this moment, support this petition and ask justice for rape victims. Rape accused should be hanged to death. Amendment should be made in laws for immediate death penality if evidence found correct, Police to conduct fair investigation and court should grant speedy justice to the victims. Along with this Indian Government should establish fast track courts in such serious and cruel cases. No appeal should be accepted by High and Supreme Court if lower court grant death punishment in rape cases. Guys time has come to define the yourself and reflect the real face of our system. </p>","victory"
"266",2019-11-29 15:07:24,"Ravi Shankar Prasad : Death Penalty for Rapist within a month","<p>Its very heart wrenching to hear about the frequently happening rape cases in India with the latest being gruesome rape of Hyderabad based veterinary doctor Priyanka Reddy.</p>
<p>A veterinary doctor, Priyanka Reddy, was r<strong>aped and burnt alive</strong> on Hyderabad-Bengaluru National Highway 44 in the wee hours of Thursday morning. Her charred body was found in the limits of Shadnagar police station. </p>
<p>After Priyanka Reddy another girl Roja from Kanchipuram raped, brutually tortured and hanged to death.</p>
<p>After every rape there is a demand to create strict rules and work on woman safety issues, but inspite of all the measures, rarest of the rare kind of rapes keep happening. There are numerous other rapes cases reports. Many of them are not reported at all due to fear of repercussions. </p>
<p>Priyanka Reddy case is just a drop in the ocean. It's another wake up call to the fact that 25,000+ rapes are reported annually in India and about 1.5 lakh are still awaiting justice. All this was discussed during Nirbhaya case too and we've achieved nothing since then so far.</p>
<p>Rape is the fourth most common crime against women in India. [According to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) 2013 annual report, <strong>24,923 rape cases</strong> were reported across India in 2012. Out of these, 24,470 were committed by someone known to the victim (98% of the cases). </p>
<p><strong>We request you to speedup the investigation and punishment in Dr Priyanka Reddys rape case and make a law to punish the guilty within 1 month by giving them capital punishment.</strong></p>","victory"

She called her sister who asked her to move to a crowded area to be safe but later when her family called her phone was switched off. Her body was found a day later in a distorted and unrecognisable condition.</p>
<p>Incidents like these happen all over the world, Hyderabad was previously considered a safe city for women.

<p>Warning,<em> humanity</em> just lost another hope, leave this article <em>without reading</em> it till the end and<em> humanity</em> would lose another one too!!</p>
<p>On<strong> 27 November 2019</strong>, she was returning to her home after completing her duties in a hospital, where she had been working for the past one year. She was brutally raped and murdered by some unknown men. On 28 November 2019, police found her half-burnt dead body 30 km away from Shadnagar, below an underpass. While she was returning home on 27 November, her two-wheeler’s tire was punctured, and some unknown men had approached her to help in repairing it. This is just the brief of the<strong> rape</strong> and murder.. err, <strong>brutal murder</strong> case.</p>
<p>The accused, <strong><em>Mohammed Pasha, Naveen, Keshavulu and Shiva</em></strong>, were identified by the police after scanning CCTV footage installed near a toll plaza where the victim had parked her two-wheeler.</p>
<p>Now even if this wasn't enough to be ashamed of as a mighty population of 1.3 billion Indians not able to guarantee security to the wombs that have nourished us all, you might be quite proud to know that <em><strong>XVideos</strong></em> has <strong>Dr. Priyanka Reddy</strong>'s name as a trending tag on its page now, which is not surprising since probably this incident was maybe just about the gang of <em><strong>Pasha</strong> </em>realizing and doing what many others <strong>wanted to</strong>. Else how would have we got our unfortunate sister's name out on the <strong>trending tags section</strong> of the website's<strong> homepage</strong>.</p>
<p>I urge you, on the behalf of another hundred sisters getting molested every other day according to the recorded stats, sign up for this petition, and urge<em><strong> XVideos</strong></em> to remove her name as soon as possible.</p>
<p>And to the government of India, I would ask you to be as serious about</p>
<ul>
<li><em>banning rapes</em></li>
<li><em>banning food and protective shelters to rapists</em></li>
<li><em>banning being afraid of such people</em></li>
<li><em>banning the oxygen supply to their lungs</em></li>
</ul>
<p>as you are about <em>banning Porn</em> in India, porn rarely makes a woman hurt, dead or raped as compared to the streets of India these days.</p>
<p>With all due respect, today and till the day this society starts acknowledging that women aren't to be taught about maintaining their clothes than men are to be taught about standing up for women's respect and not rather gazing at her body parts, I am and will be ashamed to be born in India. Sign up for the petition, drop atleast some support to a woman's name who can't be revived, pay a little respect to the women in your house by acknowledging her pain, I know you are in tears, so am I, and so should be anyone with a heart still alive.</p>","victory"
